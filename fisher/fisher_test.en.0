Hello
Hello.
Hello, Good evening. Who is this?
How's it going, hey, this is Guillermo, How are you?
Oh Guillermo
yes
Oh, this is José.
How's it going, where are you from?
Oh, but-I live here in Philadelphia.
In Philadelphia.
yes, yes, and you?
I, I am peruvian. Eh, I am studying in the University of Pennsylvania.
Oh, what do you study?
Eh, I study history
Oh I am also a student here, I'm eh, senior
What university?
from, University of Pennsylvania too.
Oh yes
yes yes Okay, I almost finish here.
Oh that's good.
But but
And you are studying, is that you?
So, I'm in Wharton
Hm
Then, if it's business, but then you are a student for a PHD, the Master's is that exactly.
is that, no, undergraduate
Ah, I'm an undergraduate ah okay, okay
Hm mm Hm mm, hm mm
Ah, but these hours here
Sorry?
But then did you live in Peru?
I, I'm sorry as you say?
Did you live in Peru?
That is, I was living in Peru until three months ago
Ah.
Clearly
Then you're a freshman
no, what happened what I studied at the University of Peru for two years and then I transferred. that is I'm an international transfer
Ah Ah, okay. So you're not an exchange student, you're a transfer?
It is clear, eh, eh, I will graduate with a degree from this university
Ah Ah that's good.
As op- as opposed to an, exchange student for example doesn't
Ah, that's good. And what do you think so far?
Eh, it's a bit hard, to tell you the truth
yes, is it of English, or is it
And, n- well, English, English in fact is a, let's say,
all, all the work.
it's a difficulty, I mean, eh, eh, y have, have studied English a larger part of my life, but anyways, it's more difficult to express myself in English, than express myself in Spanish.
yes yes
No, I mean, that is eh, very clear for me
yes
Eh, but apart from that, yes, because of the amount of work that they, that they send me, also it's a
More than in Peru?
I yes, I think so, they send you more
Mm
more, more than in Peru. Even in the last cycle, I in, in, in Peru, eh, in my university I took six classes. Eh, one semester.
Hm mm
And, and, even like that, I think that I had less work than what I'm having now taking five classes.
Mm
But well, what happens is that I'm taking five classes, but I also work.
Ah, okay, okay
I don't know, maybe that's equivalent to taking six classes, or something like that
yes yes
Maybe it's, it's a little less, I don't think it's so demanding as taking six classes
yes, but, it's still pretty intensive
I think so, yes, maybe in the future I decide to
yes, it's hard
I, I'll decide to take less classes, I don't know. How many courses do you take per cycle, more or less?
Uhm, it depends. In general, five, but ah, sometimes I think, it's just four, last cycle I only took four, but now I'm taking five
Yeah, and, and you
But, in general, people in College only take four
I see
I think, but in Wharton people generally take five
I see. And do you work, or
Eh
or are you a full time student?
I do have, I have a little job at the library, it's Work Study, but uh, it's not really a job because when I'm there
I study, so it's not like that
Ah, it's very advantageous. What, what do you do in, I also work in the library, but I'm a shelver
hmm
So, really it doesn't give me the chance to study.
Ah, I did that sometimes but no but, in, what are you doing? What part of the library? In
In the fifth floor of Van Pelt
Mm, okay, okay
Where do you work?
In Lippincott
Where's that?
It's, it's the library at Wharton
Yea
yes, it's on the second floor. Mm, no, but, yes, it's there, it's a good job because I work alone, and I don't work too many hours just five hours a week, sometimes I work ten hours a week but
that's how it is, I do my homework, really, so it's not so, well, there are, there are times, there are, yea but for the end, there's only a little bit more than a month of work left, because
there's more people who need help, and everyone
Hm mm
is doing their research and but in general, it's pretty, no, I don't have a lot of work.
Hm mm
But yes here it's eh- but what I've seen is that, for example, sometimes I, from uh, in Latin America, but you saw that in Europe,
in the universities, they give you uh, well in general, there's not a lot of work just until the end, really, so the professors
Ah, in, in, in England, for example?
uh, yea, in Europe in general, really,
yes, I've heard that too, that, I mean, the amount of, for example, of, the, the, the number of hours that you have in class each week,
Hm mm
they are less than three
Hm mm
Then you have a lot of free time. Doesn't have much class.
yes yes yes
And aside I think that yes, well they don't give you much work, no no I'm not sure, no no
yes well, well, well, them, well, no, no they don't give them much work but in general they want that we, well it is supposed true that one is
Yes that one reads all, that they are doing exercises, and that they continue doing all that true
Of course Hm mm, hm mm
I understand all the truth. And then in the end they give an exam and that is the grade. But here in the United States it's
different true. Because here, especially in history, one has to investigate, and then an essay, and then another and another exam and
Hm mm
that is the best in the sense that one, okay, that there are less risks but ay
yes, ofcourse, that that that definitely that is an advantage, no truth that there are less risks
the traba- yes, yes, but
Because, really imagine that for example you go to a a a a a decide your exam grade. All of a sudden the night before you couldn't sleep o
whichever may have happened, and all of a sudden
yes
in the exam you don't, all of a sudden you may have prepared a lot but for X reason it didn't go well in the exam. then
yes
I mean, let's say your grade
yeah,
i mean, your, your grade goes down, i don't know.
Yeah, yeah, no, but there's also all the work they give you, i mean, yeah, every week you have one thing, and another
other job, another job, so
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Every system has it's advantages. But, and, in Peru, Â¿how's it like in general?
Let's see, i mean, i would say they also make us work, i mean, we don't, we have like an equivalent to midterms
Uh um,
But they're mostly reading controls.
Uh um.
Uh, through all, i mean, spread, let's say, through the semester
Uh um.
And for some courses, not all of them, you're also asked to, at the end of the course, to deliver an essay. A research paper
Uh um.
And also, you also have a final exam. But, let's say you don't have to produce as much as you do here.
Uh um.
I mean, you don't have to write much.
Uh, um, right.
Here they're like constantly making you writing papers, and reviews, Â¿right?
yes
There not so much, I mean, there instead what you had to write, for example, you wrote it in the exam, or to give in, that is, in the investigation.
Hmm mm
In the final semester. But aside all of that, no you didn't have to produce much.
yes yes
And well, I mean, that could be seen as advantageous in the sense that you don't have, they don't ask you much, I mean
one can live more relaxed.
yes yes
but the point is, the disadvantage is that you don't come, you don't get to practice your, your, no, you are not in a constant practice of labor of
investigation, and neither about how to describe right, I mean sometimes one for not writing much, one loses  ease, right, write. So
Hm mm, hmm mm
I would tell you that, I mean, it's more, it's easier, right, I mean
yes Hmm mm, hm mm
It's easier, but I don't know if it is, say, if they form it so well like they form it here.
yes yes
But it has a cost, that your form- that is, the cost is that here they make form you better, it's good but, at least, me , for example, this final weekend, I am full of things to do, so
you live a little more,uh,  at least, I live a little more anxious, say, a little more.
yes
stressed
yes yes
But I don't know how Wharton might be I don't know.
yes well, it is, it is, it is different because in Wharton well it also depends, well.  It depends, because, for example, I say, classes I take in general, don't have
like essays or research, only in general, two, three exams, and, and that's it.  But there are classes for example that have more like that well, you have the two exams, but you also have projects.
OK.
These like case studies
And are the personal or group products?
In, groups, in general, those days almost everything is in groups.  And of course, if they give you homework, things, little things like that for one to be reviewing, because otherwise
because, and, and, and I like it like that, for example, every week you have homework, a small one you have to turn in, because, that way,
one has- they make you study every week truly.
Of course
But yes, that, that, that, I like, sometimes, they do that, but in general, they are exams, or projects.  But in
Hm mm
each class always has an exam.  I don't, I have never had a class where there were only projects, true, but in general two exams, and maybe one project.
Hm mm, hm mm
In the, then, now in the Marketing class we have, a, a project that is like a e, and- I don't know how they did it eh, eh and
they created a whole piece of software that is like a simulation and then one, for example, each request well there are like five orders, or six orders, then
you have a group
Hm mm
and then everyone, each group is assigned, a company
Hm mm
Then, one have several products, this company has several products, then, you have to decide based on, each product,well, where are we going, what kind of
how are we going to sell this product, we are going to
Ah, that is interesting
place more if, if, is, is like one, one is in a, of course is not like in the real life, but
But, well, it resembles at least in some
it helps if if, is not, is not interesting but then, then when that ends, you have to write some like that, essays, to make an analysis
of what you made, of the, the mistakes, of what you did well,
Hm Hm
Then, there are many things like that too. Then everything, everything depends on the course,but
Hm Hm
eh, yes, yes here, there is and I, hardly write anything in general. Then it looked pretty weird that I had to write
Yeah
But, em and what else, and now, ant time here, surely you donÂ´t like it, right.
How come?
Too much cold here right?
well, yes yes yes yes. I think it was on Tuesday, at night, that was raining
yes
I got frozen, yes, well. I have to go with my coat, I mean with my I have is, I bought a coat that shelters a lot
Not, yes
And I have for, well, I always go out with it. But still, sometimes even using the coat, I get cold too. But well inside my room it is more,
Hm
m- manageable the matter of, of the d- inside the dorm yea, yea the temperature is is, it's, I- it's good enough
Pe-
warm, right.
But in Peru, I've heard there are parts where it really gets cold.
Well right, yea, yes if you go to the mountains
Hm mm
also at nighttime, more than anything, well, if you go to the mountains in the wintertime, in, in winter, uh, the winter nights in the mountains are really cold yea.
Hm, yea I see.
I'd say even the, I mean, I remember once, I must have gone to the mountains in Peru, and it's something, on vacation with my family, and yea, at night
it could get even get colder than the cold I've experienced here
Hello?
Hello, my name is Glori.
Hello, Gloria. I am Paulina. Where are you calling from?
From New York.
New York. I am in Georgia.
From Long Island.
Ah?
From Long Island.
Long Island
Aha
I am in Athens, Georgia
Oh, from Georgia, on my God
Mm. How is it?
I didn't understand what she said.
What?
Something about religion. She said she talks
You didn't understand what she said.
No
She was talking about the religion, what is the opinion about religion, if it unifies people, or separate them, all the people should belong to the same religion, or whatever.
Ah, okay. Um, I am catholic. So I believe, I believe, um, it joins some and separate others. For example I have a nephew that is gay.
so, they are Catholics, they don't accept gay people,
Aha.
because they say that God didn't make them that way. So, I remember when my nephew was born, we know, wee knew that he was going to be one
People never believe that they are born that way but he was. And if you have someone in your family you know. So, he
has a lot of problems with the Catholic religion, because they don't accept him and he knows he's not accepted. So, he finally found a church, in the thirty-two, in New York, that accepts homosexuals.
I see. Well, I think that, if people would stick to their religion, there wouldn't be that many problems, they wouldn't go to extremes, every religion
Mhm. Aha.
If people would follow, for example, what Jesus Christ said, if they would follow His teachings, if they would act like He did
Mhm.
there wouldn't be a problem.
Aha.
But when they start fighting, that's not what He taught us!
Mhm.
Jesus Christ.
Exactly.
that's when trouble arises.
Mhm.
The same thing happens to Muslims.
Mhm.
or the Jews, the principles of that religions teach us to,
Mmh.
in itself, it is, they are good things.  But, when people become fanatic and don't accept other people, you respect differences,
Aha. Aha.
I believe that there is when there is division, problems.
yes, yes, yes.  Lie, this, what was I going to say? I, at lunch time, I, to the girls where I work, where I work, three,
I take, this, a little book by Joyce Myers, and he, an everyday scriptures.  And, I read them, then, they tell me, ah, that is shit, that I say, but
listen what she is saying, listen that you treat your neighbor well, like you, you would like to treat you. Ah, no, I don't have to treat her well.
I don't like her, I say, but everybody is created in the image of God.  Ay, we start to fight.  Then, I say.  Look, I want peace because what happens is that everything, and I, not to
we talk about, about, about today's subject.  But, forget it, one has been made, but still they look for me.  To- to read, everyday.
how great.
Because, there is one that is like a firecracker, and I was telling her that I don't want to hang out with her because she drains
all my energy.  And, she is always criticizing everyone, and I don't want, I don't want to be in this environment.  She says, yes I read to her everyday, the other days she is saying,
write down five things you are thankful to God for, eh, am, who do you think you are, forget it.  She always, ay, you are always reading something about religion, that
I say, that is the only thing that has saved my mind because, otherwise, if I start to criticize, that everybody criticizes me, and I know that I am a good person, and that God just like I am,
if I let people influence me, I would have already jumped out of a window.
yes
And, that is what happens to her, she is criticized, then, she I say, look, God loves you, and like you are, but you have to, you cannot be criticizing everyone.
And it is true, the same as when- the
yes
in one on one relationships, or like the religi- like a people, like, let's say, what, what happens in Israel, amongst the
Uh huh.
between the Palestinians and the,
yes. Uh huh.
and the Jews.
Uh huh.
It's sad, and they go fighting
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
because for the two there are sacred places, but they don't respect.
Uh huh, uh huh.
other people.
It's that, it's that, the, eh, eh, precisely the Catholic religion, the whole world is going, like m- my friend she went to another church. She tells me,
this, this, and this, and the other, and I say, you have to find the church where you want, that you believe, that you, fits you.
Or that in- I'm not going to tell you that you should go to the Catholic church, if it's not giving you anything because I go to Catholic church.
So, then, she, she found another church, she tells me, maybe you should go with me, I say no, leave me, to me to where I am going, I am more agreeable where I am.
And, you know, I am going to charismatic groups, so, then, n- n- I like to go to other churches, I'm not going to say that I don't go, but I don't want that she co- me
now I have been to that church, now I have been back many times. And, and it takes all day Sunday, and I don't have the whole day on Sunday to be there
three hours, four hours.
Ah, yes.
Uh huh.
What religion goes, is your friend?
I believe it's something like Christian Science.
Oh.
Yes, yes yes. They are like born again Christians, or something like that.
Yeah.
Yes, something like that. So, then you know she was Catholic. But, the husband goes to the Catholic Church. In my house, the only one going to church is me. I don't think she likes to go, she always fights with me when she goes.
And, he does not believe that God is helping him, so I, everyday I tell him, you see, God gave you that, since today we were talking about
of Katrina, and he says, ay, God made that, which
Mhm.
I could not convince him that it was not God, that it was an act, you know, an act of God, as they say, but it was not.
God himself, He does not allow them, even though the Bible said that a lot of those things would occur.  So, I was telling him to maybe read the Bible, it will show you what there is.
Mhm. Yes.
Mhm.
That's the way it is, I find that, regarding religion, many people go solely by tradition, and
Aha, yes.
When one goes and finds the, the truth,
Aha.
And really finds, there one finds a religion that,
Aha, aha. Yeah.
they like.  But, many people who also go, solely by religion, but do not even know what their own religion is about.
Exactly.  They sit there, and once the Father is finished, they leave, they run.
Yes, or they don't study what's written for themselves, or anything.
Yes.
Yes. Help when we start studying, who would believe, it's your own religion.
It-yes, yes. Like ultimately, I am going to a charismatic group. Then, I am understanding more, even though they speak in Spanish, and I don't understand, I can speak Spanish, but I can't read or write it.
So then, they gave me a Hispanic bible, and I, forget it, I am reading it, but i don't know. Then, I go and explain to them that I read this, and this, and this.
That is what, then, they read in English to see if I can understand it. But, it's much too difficult, the bible is, is
The bible, yes, the bible is difficult. The vocabulary that it uses, even though, it doesn't matter what language, I find.
E-exactly, exactly. So, I find it very difficult, so, I. they give me some, some passages, and I read them, and then they tell me this is this, and this is this, and this is this
You know, and, I begin to use it like in our lives. And, I say, Oh, okay. Then, I understand.
Mm. From where are you from?
I am Puerto Rican.
Puerto Rican. But were you born in the United States?
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. I was born in Puerto Rico but I grew up in New York, in what they call el barrio. In East what they cal el barrio, in Manhattan.
Ok-I don't know.
Yes. You know. Have you always been from Georgia?
No. I'm from Chile.
Oh, from Chile, ah, okay.
Yes. I was born and raised in Chile, and when I finished High School, I came to study at the University,
But, vi-Aja.
United States, here.
Ah,
And we have been here in Georgia, my husband and I, two years, but we have been here in the United States, eleven years.
Wow, wow,wow, wow.
I lived in Wyoming for a few months, I lived in, in Utah
Wow.
for a few years. And a year and a half in in Maryland.
Yeah, yeah,
in Washington, DC
Yeah,
And now we are in Georgia.
Wow, you travel a lot.
dog, like they say.
Yeah, that is good, that is good, to move like that. You see, I live
Yeah, yes.
I lived in Manhattan, then I lived in Bronx, and now I moved to Long Island and we stayed here. Even though, when we retired, we are going to live, I guess
in Florida. Because, mi son, my oldest son, and my grandchildren live in Florida.
Oh, so then you will go
So, I like to go, I would like to go to Florida to be close to them. But, to the time that I go, my grandson will probably will be married.
Because, he is already seventeen years old, to the time that I retire is ten years more, he will be twenty-seven.  He might be married
Maybe, somewhere else, yes.
I am going to be of -- OK
oh, yes, us, from here, who knows where we are going.  because
yes
let's see, we go to, my husband finishes his PHD
OK
two more years.  and from there, wherever there is work
oh, where there is work.  and what do you do for a living?
yes, i am at home, with my children
oh. oh, you are at home with your children. that is so nice
Mhm. I have two, two babies.  One is a year old, and the other one is three years old.
oh, my god. yes, yes it is a lot of work.  Right? I do children's party.  I dress like a clown and now I am figuring out how I can make Elmo's head
because, I have the, the bodysuit, but
oh yes
the head belongs to my friend.  Then, her and myself make the party.  Then, sometimes they request two, and we could not go.   It can only go one person
ah
so I am trying, my friend is making it, but the head is very heavy.  So, I cannot even imagine how we are going to make that head.
so, thought that, because, that is why I could not hear what you were telling me madam, because one tape of.  And, i say, ok, I am doing a lot of things, I should concentrate
Everyone at the same time, yes
Everything at once, because sometimes they call, or they don't call, and , and sometimes I answer or I do not answer.  And, they had been, they had told me that speech last week, and I do not know why they argue the same thing
oh yes?
Have you been doing this for a long time, this?
Am, I, I've done, I think ten, eleven.
Oh, like me, yes. Something like that, yes.
yes, not so much.
Oh, okay, yes.
But, the last time, that I did was of politics. No, I don't remember of what it was.
Ah, I, have a friend whose name is Norma, I think she lives in Georgia also.
Ah, yes?
yes, yes, yes. She's Peruvian. Peruvian, yes.
Ah, yes
yes, yes, yes. I've talked to her four times already.
I think so. I've talked to her twice, I think.

Uh uh.
then
But after three years of marriage you can apply for Citizenship
yes, but what happens is that I have or double-Citizenship, I have my Citizenship in Venezuela and I have my Italian Citizenship.
Because my father is Italian.
Oh. Oh, do you speak Italian?
yes, and then.
Yes
I think that if I accept the American citizenship, I'll have to
quit now
exactly, citizenship, and that's not good for me
Hmm. The other two citizenships of, but have you researched something about it? because currently in Chile we have double citizenship, it could be American citizenship
yes, but the problem is I have two, they won't let you have three
You're right
Yes
it's a little complicated
yes
Ah, they're no. Are you happy with the residence? your parents are
See
they live in Italy or Venezuela or here?
No, my mom, my parents live in Venezuela, but my dad was from Italy. He was born in Italy.
okay. Are your grandparents, your uncles in Italy?
No, uh, uh, from my dad's side, they are
okay, in Italy, I have some friends who live in Rome
Oh, no, my dad's family is in Palermo. It's close to Cicilia, to the south of
It's pretty. I've seen pictures of, of that place, and I've seen  pretty, pretty landscapes over there
Uh uh
Beautiful, and do you own any animals, dogs, cats or something like that?
No, we don't have any because we live in an apartment.
Animals are not allowed?
All my neighbors do have permission to keep animals but I don't really like to have them here locked up all day long!
Uh uh.
yes, do you have animals?
yes, I have dos, I have a cat.
Oh.
I have some plants outside the house and I have an aquarium.
Oh.
I have lots of things to have fun.
Exactly. My husband and I would like to have a dog. The thing is that here we don't, since we live in an apartment we don't have
The, yes
a garden or anything
But you can take them out for a walk. I used to live in an apartment, I moved here abut six, no, five months ago and I've been here for three months with the dog, the cat, the plant
and the aquarium. I used to take my dog out for a walk outside.
Yes, the thing is that we want to have one but it will have to be a puppy.
yes, it's the
yes, if we are going to be here all day long and not just in the evenings. We really don't want to leave the poor puppy locked up in the apartment all day long.
Ah.
This is the question. But we are thinking of moving to this
Ah, yea ? Your husband is from here, the Unitated States ? Or from Venezuela ?
no, he's from the United States.
Ah, yea. Few that are going to change soon.
if we are waiting to buy a house close from here to begin to
to move
if so we can move and thus be able to find a puppy or anything else.
For this and not feel like we moved out one month ago, recently. To me, this is my home from where I'm talking.
And we had to close the yard and place cartons all around to have the hill just outside it is so small and the dog is a labrador.
Exactly.
Then, it can enter and leave the garage but it has the gate opened and has a space where it can walk, run and play.
yes, I want it. If it can enter and leave freely, it can play in the yard and that
and has
Runs all around, exercising
and you have another ideea ? Like what kind of puppy do you want ?
yes, if you are thinking of a reason why
Ah, it's very little
not like the medium ones.
Which are ?
but I know that they look like teddies.
Ah, yes, yes, I know which they are. They are pretty and they are colored--
Hi

Okay. Uhm, how old are you?
Twenty-Five
Twenty-five
hmm, oh, twenty-eight
Okay. Sorry?
Twenty-eight
Twenty-eight, ah, me too
Ah
Well, I, I, I like all kinds of mu-, almost all kinds of music, except rap and hip hop
eh
Ahh.
Everything else, uh mm, as much Latina like American. Eh, I like everything, I like rock en Espanol, English, I like uh music.
classical opera uh dance a little bit of everything uh so what that
And, And you?
Pardon?
and above everything else i also really like live music.
How?
Live music.
Live? Uh. Like concerts?
Ahh.
Eh, a-eh, it's not much, I have liked much, I was do is, find music online
Okay.
so what that, almost all the music I have, I have around five hundred C.D.'s that I have bought and
Ahh.
a lot of them, I have looked for online
Exactly.
so what that, that for me, well it's for me, I, I need music for everything, I need it for when I work, when I study
eh I always like to have music, it's what keeps me alert, I suppose uhh mmm so what for me, music, yes, is extremely important
and it's substantive eh
Exa-
it helps me to concentrate, it helps me to rela-, to relax ehm I find, music for me can help me change my mood.  yes, ca-, I can be
Exac-
very calm and yes I listen to a song that can put me in a bad mood or the same I could be in a bad mood and can listen to a song that makes me happy
Exactly, exactly, no yes, I also I because me, no, ehm, I play I play my instrument, and my husband plays his instrument and at least, oh, maybe one that is festivals and things like that
Okay.
there is a bar that is very close to my house where many people come to play every night nothing people seit no to, and to play instrument
and there are open circles every night and there are songs of, where the people pay and then on the weekends they come here different musical groups
to play every night from, on, on the weekends and it is very cool
Okay.  Ehm, what is your favorite type of music?
I like everything.
Is there any type of music that you don't like?
I like at least ehm that I don't like that way at least that if rap hip hop or at least music, oh, pop
so that if Britney Spears and not that, I don't like it, it doesn't strike my attention at all
Okay.
I like, oh, I like a lot oh ehm at least rock in Spanish, I have a lot of rock in Spanish and bluegrass music So
Okay.  And what, do you have a favorite group?
Well, I like, at least from rock in Spanish I like Fito Paez a lot
Okay.
that is from Argentina
yes
yes, I like it a lot
Okay
and, from the American music there is a mister that we call it that's very good.
that
and the one who died, ah, him too was a very good singer but more or less, where I live, there are many people who play
Oh
many of our friends that play and sing and have bands
yes
and all of the groups that they have are, they are very very good too
Okay. well for me I only go to one or two concerts each year
but in general the type of concert I'm going to is more like, rock, in english, and the people that go are more
younger and and as it is, they are too scandalous.  So for that I didn't pay too much attention to going to concerts for that.
Ah
Well, at least this year I was at a concert of Willy Nelson
Aha
and Bob Dylan
Yes
and it had people of every age, there were people that were sixty or seventy years old and kids that were barely ten or eight years old in the concert.
Yes
yes, good, very cool. It was held in a small stadium, in a small baseball standium and there weren't so many people there because of that.
was very, very good concert.
You buy music or have many CD's?
Of course, We buy music more than anything but also we bought a lot of music from groups that are not very popular, of people we know
Yeah.
yes, because we are members of one of folk music societies of Philadelphia, then at least there are many musicians
who are members and there are concerts in the homes and they do this every month
Ok.
there was a concert in, in a house of a member and we bought all those CD's
Ok.
we see groups that are not so super, super famous, but they are good
Ok.
And sometimes we have, we have seen groups
And
that did not know they were famous and suddenly we're hearing, being in a festival or something similar
Yeah.
and suddenly we hear a song it is famous
Ok.
but
So, you say you play instruments, you and your husband play in a band or group?
No, no, no. My husband played in a group before, They are not together in that group, probable, they will be together again
okay
But no, we don't play for a group, my husband sometimes plays with his friends, but we dont really have time,
to, to compromise ourselves with other people
okay
Because of the job, and that doesn't well, it doesn't give us time to compromise ourselves that way, with a group, because if you have a group, you have to practice for at least one day.
Practice and find that
week
The promotions and
okay
yeah
So, if you have to dedicate too much time, you can get a group, there's a group that wants to play with my husband.
but where do they get together, they get together on Wednesdays at night around ten and they practice until like 2 in the morning.
Does he work, or study? how does he have time for that
yeah, um ya yo, i would have loved to learned how to play an instrument, but I'm horrible at that stuff
Music, i like music its good for me, its necessary for me, i like it.
I, i remember songs. lots of songs from
mm
Songs that i can let years pass by without listening anything else, i could keep sining those kind of songs years after years.
That happens to me, But whenever i don't listen to a song for a long time, i forget the lyrics, but the other day i was talking to a friend
and she was with her, we listened to a song on the radio that i didn't hear in about eight years, but she remembered the entire song.
And afterwards they played a song that I hadn't listened to, and it was some four years that I hadn't listened to it, and I knew the song
I knew that I knew the song but I couldn't remember the words to the song, but I remembered a little, not much. To me, if I forget or not, if not
If I don't listen all the time I forget the words, I know the song, but I forget the words a little.
Ah, well, to me, for me it's that it depends on the mood I'm in, I go for it so that it's
But I, eh, I have an Ipod. You know what Ipods are?
Uh-huh.
Eh, for me, then, eh, I have like ten thousand songs in the Ipod.
Uh-huh.
So I have in all, I have a list of music that only has music for the, the dance music.
I have a complete list that is only rock in, eh, English, that is basically what I use when I go to the gym.
Exactly
I have a list that is music only in Spanish and a list that is only classical music, opera, things like that
for relaxation.
Ah, and for studying
Eh, I have, eh, a list, well, to the contrary. For me, eh, to study I can't have that type of music, I can't have classical music, I need music. . .
Yes?
that have lyrics because if donÂ´t, if there are not lyrics I get bored, I need something to distract me
What are you studying?
Eh, Eh, I work with virus
Okay.
in biology
Okay
So, I always need something that distract me, that keeps me alert
Exactly.
yes, yes, yes I put music but not classic
Hmm
I get sleep, I put classic music when I have, many times to write a, a report, when I have to concentrate a lot, a lot, a lot
then, even since I was a little kid always, when I had to study, I always was hearing to music while singing, I could be reading and my dad always criticized that
is impossible for a person to read and sing at the same time but I donÂ´t know, it always worked with me I always got good grades, so
I suppose that
I had a teacher
not
that said that when you are not studying something like you have to, have to learn it, that if you sing it you will learn it, you learn it even
faster than the normal
yes, that doesnÂ´t , doesnÂ´t attracts me a little, the music, whatever, eh, can
Hi, hello
Hello, you are speaking with Fabiola
and they connect you, and therefore was working
yeah, and that's how it was working and they and they pay you therefore
oh, look that also
cool or not. and and that is the topic that that i tell you to chat and and from so a issue of conversation
so lets talk about memories
about the best thing that has happened in your life
ah
and how has your life changed
okay
and what's the best thing that has happened to you in your life
ahh, a lot of things
but the best thing that you feel has happened in your life
ahh
that's a good topic
yes, i meet somebody with this kids
yes
i think everything begins knowing someone, because if not had known him no
yes, i say the same
These kids must have not been here
Ahh, the best thing that has happened to me was meeting my husband
yes because how
and the second and other best thing that has happened to me was having my kids
yes
be healthy and staying healthy
for, yes because if not if i had not meet the boy, I wouldn't be here
and in reality
another wouldn't have these kids nope, I wouldn't have known you either
yes
if it had not been for
why not? it's good the thing of the good topics well that you find good conversation topics when you talk over here because they too also put the music. yesterday there was the music
yes
ah, yes and it is entertaining, you talk for twelve minutes and they themselves cut you off
well here me I like them
yes they tell you that you have thirty seconds to say goodbye
ohhh
and even though we have twelve minutes to talk about what we want because they are starting to recognize our voices
but uh, what is this called there is no need to talk about what they say
we need to talk, we need to talk about what they say or what ever you want, the idea is to talk because that is everything, the entire conversation is recorded
Ah so that after the computer knows that hu
who is who
and for him, for the accent
because the accent, the system, it's the form of speaking and
mm
the stamps I have and they are inventing something
yes for the
then they need people that have different voices
Ahh no idea, and I hadn't called because I would say no no you can't call
and the
much earlier
yes, the girls all connect using this number
yes
yes they call each other at once, at the same time
ahhh
and and they connect well they connect well
I'm going, going to try then to call after a little later or in the middle of the day perhaps, i don't know
yes but I don't know if you can make two calls at the same time
in the same day
Ahh that I don't know I can hear the voices of the beautiful kids
yes i hear them, they're here, they are
i can hear it very clear, yeah
they are both laughing
they are, and what are you doing for them to laugh?
they are are sitting on my laps and ones in front of the other and the look at each other and laugh.
they look and laugh, and say you look like me, nono you look like me.
and one has a lollipop so he throws that lollipop onto him, while they are there.
they are interesting, ohh they are growing, do you talk to them?
oh
do you talk to them now?
how?
do you talk to them, do you talk to your kids?
yes, i talk to them, i talk to them when there's time and i talk to them when
in english?
in Spanish
ohh
and in english?
in english, that's good because they are going to know to different languages.
yeah because, that's how they grow up with two languages.
yes
because yes and besides they also grow with, not having an accent
imagine me with Geni with two languages also she speaks both languages, she can read both languages but nevertheless she has an accent and has trouble with Spanish
eh
and since being little and she had the first three years, she was born here
mm
but when she was two and a half months old I took her to Chile and in Chile the same
and where did she learn how to talk? she learned to talk when she was in Chile? yes well
is that she only learned just words, she couldn't say complete phrases because
ah
we used to come here on vacation every year and one month here
ah
and her father always spoke English to her
ah so she was like confused
and of course, and so when she would hear him, she would hear a very bad Spanish from Michel
mm
or a bad English from me
ah
now I speak better English, Michel speaks better Spanish and she can read both languages and she's better but yes she gets confused when her dad
speaks with an accent and a strong accent
the bad thing that I'm doing, I mean I speak in Spanish but the bad thing is that for example when I'm with another person and they speak English
I speak to them in English understood
but isn't that bad?
because it is not but it is bad the same because it is not, because my accent is not it is not understanda
it is not good, no
and I know that they are very little now they are not going to, are not going to but that oh the same all of this is being engraved since
yes from the time they are four months old children begin to
is that
and do you have planned what you are going to do for Christmas or for thanksgiving day?
for the day of thanks we are going to go with my, with Armi's grandparents comes back something to eat because my
I see
my mother-in-law is fixing up the house
yes
so we are going to have to do to his granparents' and they together
are you planning the gifts and all of that for christmas?
what thing?
the gifts are you planning them for Christmas or not?
mm, no, not yet, no not yet
not yet
and you?
so the chi- already, the children are going to already be big for for Christmas they are going to play already
Yes
How beautiful
And you already have plans for Christmas?
I am thinking about buying, we are going to buy the tree
M

eh
we are going to see I don't know look at Michel I bought him a car
Really?
Yes
a real car or a car
a big remote control car
ahh
from 160 dollars I found it on sale for 50 dollars
And what kind of car is it?
eh, like in James Bond
oh
But it's James Bond and with remote control I am going to put it like a present from Santa Claus
Huh?
and for Jenny not yet, I am still looking for something for her, there is something that she likes a lot, it's a game boy but a new one
m, oh okay
that you, you do not use keys you touch the little things and it moves
yes
one super, super new that came out
oh
so i think i would put that one for her because i think that's what she wants
and for her birthday, what did you give her?
and a karoke
a karoke, and do you play with it or not?
yes it sings, it is good because at her age she is readings, as she reads the letters and they get darker, change color
m
then she sings the song
ahh
and yes it keeps her entertained and it is very good for her to read faster, that is super great for christmas, and my father in-law
i bought eh a gift from jonathan
m
that is one
for the
for the computer, it has eh to move the mouse
eh?
You move the mouse and it has a calculator
The mouse has a calculator?
No no no, the part where you move the mouse is a small square
Ah, that, that little plastic thing
And that
Ah, okay
So that I bought one for me and one for us on the part of Jonathan
Eh?
Eh and believe that that, the other good idea y and don't know because more
And they are going to be here for Christmas or are they going going to?
No we already bought the tickets, we will leave for Arkansas for 15, a week
a week
Mhm, every year we go for a week
Oh, I Cristina told you the other time that they are thinking about going to Chile for work
Oh yes
And from there it won't function
No but it still has not begun
But she said that at least no and all the things that
Clearly but at least, it is not true
mm
they told her/him that it is, they have the personnel, if anything happens, they'll let him/her know
yes
that's how we later call you
something like that
but it turns out that she/he hasn't started the job in Chile
Oh
it's still, i also, hey, i got excited, i told Michel, Michel, if we get it, we go
he would go
Michel yes, yes, but
m
eh same I think but I say how can we not go if recently we bought the house,How? you say
eh
we sell it well I get giggly because for him is so easy like that just get rid of things take and then dispose off them
and for me is very hard
because it cost you a lot same to find the house
yes then to put together. I tell you now also I still not put curtains they are getting here slowly
eh?
We bought at JCPenny
m
they get here little by little first some curtains got here then last night one for the upstairs side
eh?
then I got the other upstairs part and I still need, am needing three curtains that need to get here
and they are,they are the living room curtains o?
The ones in the living dining room because how you say I did not use blinds
ah you did not use blinds?
NO BECAUSE THE REST OF THE HOUSE i USE blinds but not the living dining room because they are not  regular windows they are big windows
ahh
then they do not exist in that size unless you have one made exclusive for them
especially for
Hi,
Hi
Â¿Who's this?
My name is Annie
Hi Annie, I'm Arturo
Hi Arturo.
Â¿Where are you calling from?
Miami
From Miami, very good, I'm calling from
Â¿from where?
Philadelphia
Philadelphia
Yeah, Â¿where are you from?
Uh, Puerto Rican
Oh, OK
Â¿And you?
I'm Mexican
Oh
Yes
Â¿Are you studying here in the United States?
yes, exactly
That's good,
Â¿do you study or work?
No, uh, i have a twenty-three months old daughter and i have a four days old son now
Oh, hey, that's cute
So, no, I'm working, but no
Yes, well, of course
Not outside of home
Yes, of course, a lot of work at home i imagine
Yes
That's good, but very happy, i imagine, right?
Yes, a little tired now but very happy
Yes, your son is four days
Four days
wow, a little
yes,
So young, hey, and uh, then, Â¿why do you live in the United States? Â¿have you lived there your whole life or?
Yes, uh, my parents are from Dominican Republic
Okay
And in the nineteen seventy something, i don't know exactly when it was
mh mhm
ah, I believe it was sixty-three, I am not sure
mhm
But a revolution in Santo Domingo
OK
And they went to live to Puerto Rico
ah, OK
Then they went to live twenty-ish years there
aha
Then from there, my sister when she went to college came here to the state of Florida then we moved to Miami
ah, OK
And I had like I think I was five years old
ah, very small
yes my sister is ten, eleven years older
ah, OK
Then from there we, you know, we stayed and
yes,
eh, I, I went to school here and you know we made a life here
yes, yes, of course
And
And now are you married with, is it with a Latino, or an American?
An American
Ah, OK, I see
yes, I met him at University
ah, OK this from here in, in Miami I suppose
No, eh I went to
Ah, OK
In
OK
Then I met him there
ah, I see, very good,
Then
And
after, ah
And what, what language do you speak with, with this, with your, well it is that now you don't want to talk yet, your children true because
Well
He is twenty-four months the other no,
eh, she, she is twenty-three months and the other is four days old
twenty three, yes, well no it is
I what we do here  that when he is not here, in, my husband is not at home
mm
I speak completely in Spanish to my daughter
okay
So then when he's here we speak completely in English
ah, okay
And like that she can know both languages
recognize them,
And, and I get surprised because many times she says things
Oh, yes
That I hadn't even realized she had already learned
Oh, really
It could be in English or in Spanish
wow aha,
So she's already learning
Very fast
yes,
also, I mean like at what age do kids start talking normally, I really don't know
And mm I think it was, she was, let's say fifteen, sixteen months
okay
Since she's learning English and Spanish
aha
Hey, you take the kids that take a little more time to talk
yes, yes,
So I picked up my little girl you know, and her friends or whatever, her little friends
yes,
Eh, she needs to speak louder than she is
yes,
ah, until recently
ah
So I knew that she could understand it and could speak
yes, but
But he had to learn the language that was a little more difficult
of course, it is much more difficult, but I believe it will be good in the long run but not very good, so far with the language is an advantage
yes, yes
the truth
So eh, but, you know it, I know that she understood
mm
What I was saying in English and Spanish
yes, yes, I imagine
Now, you know, I know that she understands me because when she doesn't know how to do something it makes her feel dumb I know
yes
I see her little face, and I know she understands me, exactly
yes, of course, but children are very clever, and then, no
yes, yes
You know
so, you know, she understands it, she speaks it
hmm
And
Well, I hope she stays like that, because then when she's growing, and a lot of her friends speak English, she's going to practice English more, I think
yes, and, uh, we're not going to send her to school, we're going to home-school her
ah, okay
Because I am, was a teacher
ah
Then I think that, instead of going and teaching, you know, someone else's kids, I should stay home
yeah
And I can teach my own children
yes, that's true
So
but, what do you think about her not having school mates?
Well
That's also not an experience, bone
yes, there are many programs here in Miami, for people who teach their children at home
aha
Then, usually once a week, they will be together
ah, okay
Then it's like school, they have a class that they'll have to teach in English or at the University, whatever, but as a school that meets once a week
ah, okay
So, and also you know, with friends and stuff, I have many friends and family who have done that
the
mhm, and I don't have any problems
ah, okay
known, but also not something that
yes,
Because to me, that worries me too, I want her to have lots of friends and all that
yes, of course that's what I was thinking, that's part of the experience, no, to be in school with people you know
yes, yes,
So I think that too, it's important, you don't need that when you're a kid, because to have true friends is very important
yes, yes
I don't think so,
yes, yes,
But yes as long as she has contact with other people for at least once a week only
And also you know, they have the sports, of, in other words the places in the community
yes there are many, is that here there's a lot of contribution from the community, right and that
yes, so you know, thing like that is how they How do you say it, they socialize
yes, I see
So you know,
yes, yes, yes since in Mexico that's not common you understand, it doesn't happen at all
yes,
So I don't know anyone who has come out from that type of school, you understand. and I've always been very curious about how they do it here in the United States, because here I do know is much more common, there are a lot of people that
That come from home schooling Oh, well at least before now I don't know
yes, is you know, is like any other experience, is how you take it, you know, it can be good or it can be bad
yes, yes, yes, yes
But I also think how the schools are here, also how the kids are
it can be very bad also, right
yes that also I would like for her to have friends and all those things, but at the same time I think I have to protect her
yes, of course but you have to be careful because then again is bad to over protect them
yes, yes
It can be very bad
yes, but for that reason is that I want to teach her because I can teach her anything, but it depends how I present it to her
yes.
You know
yes, yes
it's a little different than, let's say what they show you in school
yes, that's true. And until what grade do you think to home school her?
I don't know. I haven't given it much thought since she's only two years old
yes
And I haven't started
In time we'll see
yes, so
But what do you think, I mean, are you planning to teach him the whole elementary grades
ah, it would probably be until, at least sixth grade
Okay
Then from there, we'll see because I don't know, you know, I, I can teach her up to High School
Ah, yes
ah
So, you've taught classes up to high school, or what?
yes, yes
well, and which subjects?
well, I, I was an special education teacher
yeah
So I taught everything.
oh OK I see.
So now you know, the only thing is that, if you don't agree I won't do it.
yep.
If I don't understand the topic I teach it to myself and then I am able to teach it to the kids.
Alright, OK I see.
So you know how are we going to say algebra.
nop
It's not that I don't know it but I could forget it.
if
because I don't use it
yep
so um, you know, before I started the class I kind of remembered everything
nop
What is it that I had to do
yes off course
So I could teach them
oh OK
SO for me that isn't so hard I know for someone else it could be but not for me.
yes but like i said in high school the subjects kind of get more specialized like chemistry is more advanced and physics is more advanced.
Likely this time, I know that now
aha
They have classes for kids that can take and solve them on the computer
yes
and they can go to high school, let us say it on the internet
yes
You know, there are many many many options, itÂ´s not only that
yes, yes, yes
You know, that one must
yes, no
to register the (person!?) in a public school
mhm
Do you know, I know that these Universities
mhm
Have classes for kids too, in high schools that can be taken in the University
yes, I heard about that
Therefore you know, we have many options
Very good, very good luck
and
But like you say it, but heÂ´s barely two years old and right now thereÂ´s no need to think a lot about this.
No, but since my husband says, you know, that I'm a teacher
aha
I'm always reading her books, I'm, you know, singing her songs
mm
so that she, you know, she's having fun but at the same time, she's learning something always
yes, okay
so you know I'm not really giving her formal schooling
okay
But I am giving oh I'm teaching her
mm
Little by little, she already knows the alphabet. Well she knows the song
yes, she reads
yes, aha, so she already knows the numbers
yes,
A little, you know, if I tell her one she can tell me Two, three, then the next one she tells me, she already knows that eight comes after seven, you know things like that
yes, she already knows the order
yes, not all, but little by little
yes, That's good
So you know, like
yes, sounds, sounds very interesting
yes
I don't know anything, I don't know I mean if I was in that situation, I don't know how I would do it because I could never imagine how
I can give my son classes I couldn't because to tell you the truth I'm not so, I didn't have an education to be able to give classes, you understand
mm
I imagine you must have studied something like Education or something like that no?
Well
what did you study?
I studied yes education but they didn't exactly teach me how to teach a kid let's say how to teach a kid to read
yes, no
All those things I had to learn when I was working
aha
So I'm using the experience
of course, of course, all that you acquired all the schools gave classes
yes, But for that reason, is that, you know I, for me to do it with my son
mm
Is not a problem because I already have the experience, I don't know, you know How other people do it
My name is Mariza
hello good afternoon, my name is Lorena I am here in San Antonio, Texas
hello
hello eh well today's topic is very moving eh
yes, it has also been hard for me to think abut which one is better and which one is but
exactly, now I said well it is going to be memories, I said well memories are like precisely the most important thing that can happen in life, because you live, off of memories, no
exactly, with so much, eh, with so- and I don't know the more time goes by, more memories there are, i don't know, I wouldn't know which one to choose to start with
ah
for example the best
that's how it is, the best well I am a mom
yes me too
and maybe yes, yes I would like to think about the best that has happened to me, maybe it is that, to have had my children, I remember that at the moment in which I was having him I said, this is the best that has happened my whole life then I want
of course
I want to be consistent let's say with this comment that I made to myself at the moment that something was happened but however there must be also other things
wonderful and maybe you cannot select just one really
of course well that is what I was thinking that and also I asked that if that had not happened how your life would have been different.  In your case, not having had your children
yes, yes, yes well I wouldn't have liked it
it is, it is
because, because now they are bigger they have given me well so many beautiful things, that maybe by myself it wouldn't have been enough to get so many memories and so many
eh positive and negative emotions, then well well not everything is beautiful, no I have precisely well I have a son who, who has some pro, a health problem and that is also very painful, no
yes
and, and well this but nevertheless emotions are more maybe more like love and more tender and more eh well and the husband is there, right, the husband
yes, and it's that no yes yes but the children, the children
that also has a lot, a lot to do
yes
in, in one's life, no, and this
no
but yes I, I would think that it can't be just one just one event
sure,
now a painful event, an painful memory, the death of my mother for example
sure, yes, the death of a family member or a loved one has to be the worst that can happen to someone
yes yes, yes or a son's illness, also, no, that also
also
it's very painful, but as I say, you can't eh say that only you, but it's nice to try to think about it, no
sure like the second part of my question, it was that that, that what would have been of your life if not, if that had not happened, that negative or painful event
eh yes
I mean that it wouldn't be that person would be now still for example in my case, my mom alive, but my, my grandparents both died a long time ago
and I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to them because I lived far away, so that maybe the would be that that what would have been of the my life would have been different, if not because of course they couldn't meet my husband, or my daughter either.
so then yes
exactly, exactly mhm
sure, life would be pretty different
mhm, your husband, where did you meet him?
here in the United States, almost by chance
aha, because you are from Spain
I, yes, I'm from Spain
aha, yes
so I came here to study but I met him and I ended up staying and I've been here for twelve years now
aha
and I have a five year old girl, I can tell you, my life has changed, sure, because kids change parent's lives, but she is still very young and I still have some time
yes, yes, sure, aha
and so, well, nothing, I know, it's different when kids are older, they become more independent but I still have to go through that
yes, yes, and, there's so many things, many phases.
and sure,
but oh well, at this age is when kids are more loving
yes, yes, everybody says that
mhm, it's a very loving phase and well, when they grow up they go out and do their own things and, for example, that's nice too but you don't get that much love as you used to
now, mom, well I had a good time, and hey mom, well mom, this is more like a conversation, like a different level
and they don't depend on you that much, they are not that close
yes
but it's really nice, it really is, so, to you, what is the best thing that has happened to you, your best memory
well I believe that, the same like you, to, to have children eh, well I only have one, and I don't believe that, I don't know if I'll have more
okay
was not, not I mean I don't believe I was ready to being mother maybe because it was a big change and oh the pregnancy was really hard and the, oh
the, we have raised her, my husb- my husband and I here both alone, then it was a little bit difficult but also was of course to have a kid change your life, then so it is the best that have happened to me I say
until now
yes
eh, It can be compare with anything that's what I say
yes it's true, it is what I right now has been instant, I thought that like more have past well have some nice memories in life about the achievements that you had
of course
so like a person, in the sports in or in the academic life or in the work, no
of course and, and why the, the other questions was what could be different if I have not lived that maybe have not being mother well my life would be very different
I had finished the studies too, had
right exactly
of course, got a more more important career, or had travel more or met some other person, but of course you never know you only can imagine.
Exactly, exactly and however you go accumulating
yes but
memories in Christmas pictures and in the high school festivals pictures and in the kids sports festivals pictures
oh
it is like precisely, putting together this life because it is  like it was made of memories, not
exactly yes, I have thousands and thousands of pictures, all of them are of, of my are all are of my daughter, that's because, the
it's easy to say what is most important, eh because excluding that off course, without that i don't know, i traveled allot, I've met interesting people  that you can't compare with
with the children i guess
mhm yes because this is like, like a whole and you don't study to become mother, you don't study to become
no
the human being doesn't study how to love but finally the emotion is more profound and complete, no
yes like i was saying to my sister she doesn't have any children and i say to her, until you become a mother you would not know how is like being a woman
complete because they have, like 20 years married but no, they don't have any children and i don't think they will and then it's difficult to explain
it's difficult to explain them
it's difficult to explain one like they say
but, but one says that i had one because i wouldn't like to lose it
yes a had him because i say i already had thirty years, and i said it was time to have one, have one now or don't bother if we get to old because
of course to raise a child you have to have a lot of patience and energy, and lots
lots of energy, indeed
of all yes, my daughter requires a lot of patience and sacrifice
aha
and
yes, actually for example she, because she's very playful
she's very active, more like hyper-active not like me when i was a child, i was lot more quiet and did all my fathers said, she is a lot more
she is more like three, sometimes is
yes, yes, yes,
I finish tired, after all those days, but well, she's like that, she is like that, one has to accept their children the way they are
that's how it is yeah, yeah, yes,
and
and this now I understand a lot because they are that way and everything they permit to happen because they have a strong and active character, no
yes that is what I think, or do I wait for her
I believe she will achieve many things
yes yes, if i compare her to my niece, they are so different, I think that my daughter i don't know, she has a much stronger character perhaps that will help her in the future to get ahead
yes, with, with all the difficult things that will confront her, the challenges
clearly
no, I have a daughter, the youngest is a bit like that and on top of being really good in her studies she is also an excellent sportsperson
yes exactly, that is what we want, we want my daughter to also practice a sport but we want to wait until she's a bit older because she's just five years old maybe she's much too young but
she has the body to become a sportsperson and perhaps that will help her develop more and
perhaps her character could too
yes
like also guide, no mhm
and, and perhaps calm her
and that she can get tired
yes, yes I need this because sometimes we go to sleep before her, we can't continue like this
yes, yes yes she needs to get tired, what ridiculousness
i don't know they tell me that it's the age
Where do you live?
We are living in Philadelphia right now
oh in Philadelphia, I have my oldest daughter studying at the university of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
oh what a coincidence, it is a good university
yes yes yes it is then in Philadelphia
yes, yes here it is a city where many people come to study, many young people one of the most important ones, that that is also another important things as well, education
Eh and yeah.
Yeah, of course
Of course I would like for my daughter to go to the university as well, but I am still many years away from that
Yes, but of course she will do it. What did you study?
Me, criminal justice, well, psychology, but I did not finish the degree.
Aha, aha.
Well after I was pregnant, the girl, we wanted to raise her at home, we did not want to take her to a day care because we felt that, I don't know, it's the traditional form that I was raised, that I was with my parents, they took care of me
mhm, mhm
we did not want to leave her alone in a daycare, alone
that is a good decision
yes yes, it is good, eh?
I support her, I have to take a lot of vitamins to have the necessary energy
yes, while it is possible, and now yeah, yes, yes, yes and
and now you will see how quickly time passes, yes, I, celebrated my youngest daughter's fifteenth birthday yesterday
wow
and now when, when you look back you will have many more memories, many more memories of what she did, that will be yours because
they achieve great things thanks to the support that parents can give, and from what is given, what you are giving, not like you are saying that you leave to one side
maybe your thing is more personal, your career, your profession
yes
Well, my name is Claudia Ivette. With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?
Hi my name is Juan
oh, it's a pleasure, Juan
the pleasure is all mine. Where are you?
excuse me?
ah, Where are you?
ah, I'm here in the state of Idaho
yeah
in a place called Robert, uh, and where are you speaking from?
ah, okay, I'm in Texas, in San Antonio
wow, a little far away
yeah, I'm right here
yeah, yeah, well, you see, we got the subject of movies
no yes
well, I don't, about the ratings I don't understand a lot, I know that there are movies that are, PG thirteen, PG
yeah
and actually I've seen some that have more swear words that are PG thir eh, eh, they're like more violent and more
the PGs are more like that, the PGs than the PG thirteens, I've noticed
ah, yes
then I don't understand a lot of that
Well, uh, you know, i don't, ok, i haven't taken into consideration those, those classifications
OK
I can't understand them very well
OK
I think they are, uh, a little bit complicated, instead, they should have a little bit more information about what they have.
Yeah, that's true
Ok, but in general, as i no longer have little children
Yes
Uh, children, well, i don't worry too much
Yes
About those classifications; however, i worry because when we go to see a movie that's worthy, that's interesting and not just any movie, then the classification...
Yes
I'm not so interested in that as much as i am in the quality and the comments i hear about the movies, right?
Right
That's it, that's what I'm interested about, it's, i don't know if you do the same, if you always go with... go alone or if you go with someone
No, I'm married, I've been married for three years and i do have a kid, he's 20 months old
Right.
So, he's just about to turn two years old, and yes, as a matter of fact I'm concerned about that, what we do, well, my husband more than anything.
For example, he, if we watch a movie and we really love it, we love it if it's ~PG or  ~PG 13
Right
What we watch the most, we don't really like, neither him nor myself, to watch adult movies, or those that
Uh-huh.
up to PG13
oh, yes.
Those, or at times one that is R, but the truth is that I don't pay attention, for example if there is a movie that we like
yes
We buy it and we have, for example, sometimes it has nude scenes or something like that, my husband grabs the movie and erases that part.
Oh.
And we do it mostly because, for example there are times when neither my husband nor me are going to be there, so then the children might grab the movie and could watch it.
So for that my husband will record some commercial or other thing.
Uh-huh.
Then really they can watch the movie but they are not going to see, well at the best it will be purely cars or action.
yes
But for example, if you take away or erase the part that is a bit pornographic, because you see that always, even though it's a good movie it always has to have some nudity.
yes
At times it has nothing to do with it, but
There is always something
We have movies that are action or cars, and suddenly up comes something that has nothing to do with that, but
Yes, it has nothing to do with it, yes.
So then that is what we've done, because we are going to have other children and once in a while they will be alone and we don't have to worry that they are going to watch a movie, then
There will be no problem, but
yes, yes, I believe that in that sense, you might be right
yes,
oh, look that very curiously
yeah,
What worries me the most in the movies is language and the violence
oh, yes, because it really
generally because, like you say, when there is an exaggeration in language
yes,
or in violence, everything else is the same
yes
so when the movie is like that, R, well obviously it will have scenes of all types.
no, yes
those are free, so then, R appear more than restricted, they look more like, if you don't have much information about the movie it's exaggerated in all levels
yeah, oh, yes, besides, for example we have found movies that are for children, or rather, they are not for children but when
showing the ones that supposedly are PG-thrirteen that is for children of thirteen years of age, that can see it then, but sometimes, they say, like you say, vocabulary and sometimes they show scenes that
of nudity and that, so then, I say, since they will be watching, well
yes,
I don't know, I am, I am Mexican
Mhm
that and really there for example yet, ah still on television they care of you and still on movies they still care of you a bit
yes, but look at that
I say, ah, I don't know, I don't know it makes me
makning making memmoryof the movies we have gone to see lately, they are all
very fast, um
PG thirteen or something like that I don't know where to hold it because the ones we have around here
aha aha
available at the theaters no
aha
they are, simply not really good
no yes
then no, let's not worry much abouth that information because my kids are already teenagers we always go to the theater all together
aha
we always go for the quality of the movie more than anything else then
yes
the, the classification they have to orieented us about the movies, it really does not give us much information, no
sometimes it does not say anything, because sometimes for example is says
we don't take it in consideration
and , and it changes for example and when you are watching it, bang, it's, is different to what it told you
aha
oh yes, for example, it says something like "it has too much violence" and then it's not that violent, or sometimes, it is or not, no, it doesn't clearly state the information
so, sometimes
aha
you don't even pay attention to it because, for example
yes, no, eh
those things that they sell, for example, to sell TV sets, that, that you see
what
that they remove or block bad words and stuff like that, those work sometimes but they don't all the time, they work but let's say, well, I don't really own one
but one of my friends does and she says they don't work, they don't work properly because they sometimes block words that are not that bad, they are not really bad words, and then really cuss words are not blocked
yes
so, uff
you see, that's when I think we should be involved in the education of our children
aha
we've never done any acts, of censorship, we
yes
we've tried to discuss or talk about the issue when we see strong scenes
yes
we discuss them and we tell them this happens and when we are worried about this, we say "hey, that was really unnecessary, they could've cut it out of the film, that was rude"
yes, yes
no, we analyze it and so we take advantage of it as a way to educate our kids.
yes
it generally works for us, it works really good, it has, I don't, they are older now
yes
and now, he has good common sense about which movies to watch and which ones
yes, you see, that's true, that's a great idea. I remember when my mom would watch a movie with me and we would always watch movies after ten in the evening because
we knew that we were always going to find
aha
or my mom would take a chance to try and get  ugly movies
aha
the ones that are not made for children, but for example, she would say, I don't know, if they were airing a movie that had bad language
yes
or something different than nudity, but still, like with little clothes on or when we were kids, for example, my mom would say
aha
you can watch it and then you will understand more and she would say
yes
that because when you say, "turn around, look away, you are not supposed to see that" it's like you are telling them to do so, the teenagers will do it because they are wondering why their mom told them not to watch
sure
If the movie is playing on television they are wondering why they can't watch it, why they are not allowed to
so, they are going to find out about those things in the end, they are going to have opportunities to see all those things
so, I don't think, yes, yes
But what, yes talking, about those things, is that censure or the information that, that should be censured or
yes
that type of thing I have never though of it has good because
No, yes, I believe that
well, that there is too much information about movies that it would be convenient to go see with your family
yes
and after the movie, eat together, what happens is, and inform ourselves what the movie is about, the message, the quality with which is made  and so on
yes, yes, it's true
because the restrictions that they put, well, like you said, there is too much violence that can be found in cartoons
yea,
there are cartoons that are made for children and has exaggerated violence, not
oh, yes, and that is not, and are shown during the day, true?
yeah, exactly and in the, in the, in general I think that, that eighty percent of the movies are bad, that you must not see them
yes, yeah, yeah, right?
no, and of the other maybe some are medium, and less than five percent are worth watching
yes
No, but with those you have enough to have an, an idea of that it is, what you must be looking for, right
yes
there are enough, it does not mean that not enough movies are not made, but so many are made, you don't have to see them all.
That's true
Right, and then
That's true
Yeah, we try, for example, like, knowing who they are before we go to a movie
Right
About the critics towards that movie and then we go.
Yes
Its, that's what we always look for, we go to see this movie
Right
and we've already made a decision, about what movies, and since my kids were little, they've had that education because he like the movies a lot, my wife and i love the movies, so
Right
Never, even when they were, when they were little
Right
If there was a movie sometimes we took them even if it was for older people, right?
Right
And yeah, maybe there could be some scenes, a little stronger, but one scene doesn't necessarily make the movie
right
so we tried to talk about the message, Â¿right?, for example, a lot of war movies, Â¿right?
Yes
A lot of war movies are, for example, saving private
yes, good evening.
Good Good evening I am Joe
What is your name?
Joe
Joe?
yes, and what if your name?
Alex.
Alex, where are you from?
Ah, uh, I am here in Los Angeles I think we've spoken before about religion.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course, I remember, I remem-
We talked on the fourth of october, it's been some time now.
Eh, what a memory. yes, yes I remember, how couldn't I.
Where are you from again?
I am from Colorado. Ah, Denver, Colorado.
Oh, yes. yes.
Well, and what do you think about tonight's topic?
Ah. I, I watch television by, by quality not, not by classifications.
yes, me too, I don't pay much attention to the classification , apart from and I am at an adult stage no of course I have a little girl that
always keeping an eye on what they watch I don't want her to watch programs that uh, will give her nightmares or will give her bad, ah motivations but there are a lot
of permissive things also in the for example, the movies out there, well every time are, I now think that it's more violent. I don't know if
enough to classify because they are making very violent movies with lots of topics
yes, no, I, I think I am interested in movies and television thru the topics they have
yes
Now if it is violent but does not have quality, it is ot a good movie.  But if it has some violence but it is teaching us something
like a documentary or something from life, then it has value
sure
because one cannot deny the truth of life
sure
one cannot live life with blind eyes
like the movie that is, well the allies, about the Iraq war that, I believe is about the experience the soldiers are having
this one with the colored actor, his name is Jamie, I think it is Jamie Foxx
yes
and then there's is another white boy that looks like eh, is traumatized or something when he is experimenting in Irak.  Those things are very real and they happen every day there
And those movies may be also a political critique
and yes, true
of the Bush administration, maybe it always been an administration obessesed with war
yes
with Iraq and misstrusting the public
yes, transfering many things from outside of the lie he told in order to invade Iraq that is really ah, now one looks and really no, no
it is not worthy to do that, more than one thousand soldiers already died
Those movies are very important because the majority of the people are very ignorant of the things that happen in the ge-, in life
because you don't have information
yes, it's true
The information that, we get is all propaganda then is very important to see other versions of what happens in the world, not only the Bush administration's version
yes, it's true. So i, i think that movie classification today is rather relative. I know they have from thirteen, they clearly know that ~X are
obvious, true ? But i think that ~R, these days is well beyond what is permitted or not. Eh, eh, that i agree with
allot of movies, true ? that don't make sense for example, you have a lot of gang movies that are gangs with lots of gangsters are the ones you see because like
Mhm
they need to see the violence
Those movies are bad
yes, very bad
Because they show the violence
And it glorifies it someway
yes and, and they the do it no for the value, only to sell
And that isn't for selling to
certain peoples.
yes, that's why i see sometimes you boys copying that in the way they dress or walk and even talk or co-, because those are their heroes
and that isn't right, that is, is corrupting the young. Tose shows, and movies teach them the, fake values and isn't right but the
society, the parents, the family has a lot to do to make them understand those things and how to treat them, true ? I to my daughter, i don't, when
i see something and i don't what her to see it, i don't, like, i don't force here in such a manner diji-, saying, okay, don't watch that
or if not, I try in an educational way to teach her why this program is not good for her, instead of imposing it by force, in other words.
Um, I, me too I have a fourteen year old son
Mm.
and every time he comes to visit me I have to  set the control on the sex channels.
Oh, yes.
yes, because he's obsessed with that, because when I leave I go to work and he watches that.
yes, is easy that
So I have had to control him, he can't do it anymore because I, I already have it controlled, but I have it controlled because it took the step to control it.
yes,
Not because of the classifications. So it is the job of each mom and dad to control the television that their kids are going to watch and not blame the classifications.
yes, exactly. Well in, in my house I have basic cable and so there's no channel that, that crosses the line
Do you have teenagers?
no, my daughter is only five years old
Oh, yes, a girl.
so eh, there's a, there's a Disney channel that she loves to watch and also we watch the discovery channel which she likes, and there's another other
comedy program that are not that bad that we both watch together that she likes to laugh a lot, she likes funny things,
but when there are things that go beyond, that cross the line, well I don't let her watch it because I don't want her to learn those things.
They make those things interesting when, is not morally correct, or socially correct.
yes, you, you can teach your kids but, the truth is that you as a parent should not have your eyes closed, specially when
they get older because they are going to have more temptations than what we had.
yes, e-
No because we are not good fathers according to culture.
Which culture is more
Because today's teenage culture involves gangs, hip hop music, a lot of sex and a lot of violence.
The videos
the videos
yes, all of these things
and it's not easy to control everything that you try and one, I try to explain the consequences if you do this.
yes, he does that if he has sex with a girl there are consequences, that can occur, what can happen? I'd like to understand.
yes
One has that uh to continuously talk to them about the things that the parents see because I I am a substitute teacher in school.
yes
they care a a lot about the boys when they are five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten years old but when they are thinking they need help the parents are not there.
We begin to fail and these boys have a lot of temptation and
the teenage years are critical
and its the teenage years where they start to do more in the life of a boy.
Exactly
not only when he is five or six years old
It's the manner and reason and to think they say we were teenagers also, I remember how I was in those years
I had my rebellious spirit and all these things but it's when parental guidance is most necessary.
E-, exactly. Exactly. Then all depends on the education from the fathers, the way they're into the young ones' lives no, no the, not the clasifications
The classification is just a number
Yes. And if anyone comes to see, it's like when they're all alone with their friends. They can see whatever they want because there is nobody to forbid them to do it
yes.
Eh, but if anybody helps him by taking him the good way in, about what is good and what is wrong, That helps a lot to reason before doing
To make a wrong choice
We must give the boys a basis, what's good and what's wrong, not only when they are five or six years old but when they're fifteen, sixteen, eighteen years old
Exactly
and it is more important when they're fifteen than when they're five, because when they're five they're going to follow the easy rules
yes.
But when they're already fourteen or fifteen, that's another story, friend
They believe themselves more independents, that they don't need their parents anymore
They already have friend, they're already involved in culture
yes.
Mom or dad must go to work, they do not have always time, it's difficult
yes, and young people influence nowadays is pretty big, I am... I agree, but I remember I also was influenced by my, my friends and so when I was younger.
But I can see that technologies and such things are greater. Because really the movies, back in time when I was a boy weren't as violent as they are now
There wasn't video games either, television was more restricted, Neither all that modern violence, nor blood, or bodies were shown like the ~C ~S ~I and all those shows are pretty graphic, classics
that show things like if they were real
Mhm
Well, it's, eh, young people get use to watch that as acceptable but when I was growing up, if those things were shown, it would've been chaos!
in fact, it wouldn't have been allowed at all, but it's true, times are changing and that's why, young people are influenced by it
in a big and negative way, that this things are acceptable in our society. And I, well
yes.
I, I hope that when my girl gets to that age, becomes a teenager, well, that I'm
Now, that's going to be in a very little time, my friend
yes, I know, time flies.
Time flies.
I remember when she used to be a little baby and now she's jumping, running everywhere, learning lots of new things, being curious and asking lots of questions.
Hello, my name is my name is Marisa from Philadelphia
Hello, Marisa, this is Carolina, from here, from Los Angeles.
Hello, good evening.
Eh, well, well, here it is good afternoon
Today, really, it is three hours earlier, yes
Ah, I said, my mother, how is it going to be? Listen, today we have a very difficult topic
Very difficult, yes.
Ay, my dear mother, because I am from Venezuela.
Mm.
Where are you from?
I am a Spaniard.
Oh, OK.
Well
And, and, you know that now we are living a very critical moment, exactly, with with the United States and the, our new president
yes.
and then o my dear mom
Yes I, and well, I go through something similar, what I have to say about the United States is not very positive either for-, because ah mm, I am not for a leftist either, in any case, then well
Wow,
of, the United States which is, what
it is strong, it is
it's very fe-
strong, and even, I don't know if you for some chance of life you have this, knowledge of a page that's called, eh, TV For All
and there you can see the television channels of
No.
all the countries of the world including, of course, Spain.
Ah, yes.
Uh huh, it's called that, T V pu-, eh, T eh, T  V a four
T V for all Oh.
Uh huh, a four, four and all A L L like television for everyone, something like that.
Oh.
this, there you can see, good, and we randomly eh, we have been looking, eh a particular channel from Venezuela
Mhm.
and, it's a channel, of course of the state but, but really now the state not like before that it was of the state, but as if it wasn't
Mhm.
and then now we can eh, really see the truth, what is that which is happening this, that which never was said and especially with our president who is a person very
as we say in Venezuela, clear and rough
Mhm.
eh, I don't know if you have had the opportunity to hear him in some opportunity.
Well I think so. Yes, on television and de-, after that of ah mm Ah mm. The Summits of the Americas and all that was happening there.
Exactly, exactly, then-
yes, yes, they air it here, in , in Philadelphia, you have various Hispanic channels like Telemundo, Univision
Aha, same
Galavision and all that
Smae as here
And you hear it all, yes, and
But you know that all those people, regrettably, then no, they air whatever they want, me-
Is not that, here too, here we have Government control, we say that
Exactly, exactly
eh, only, we only hear that no-, what they want us to hear
Correctly , correctly, and they put, including this, sometimes they twist
Mhm
they twist what is happening and then i always meet people that, for example, say damn, you, what do you have to say about that crazy guy you have as president ?
i do, mother, they touch me the spot, truly , that is i totally agree with that crazy guy, ah, right what i din want to
say to you was, that, after they tell all those atrocities, no ?
Mm
and i, my God, i try to have patience, because it's a delicate issue
yes
including now, i didn't have any, inconvenient here eh, including with, some Venezuela people
Mm
eh, people that have lots of years here and lack the knowledge about what really happens there
yes
and besides that, they are afraid of the idea that they have been slfd, that communism, that I don't know what that FIdel and that this and that and
well, I really don't know, how, how much knowledge you have but ehm, for example,  the situation that we are living in Venezuela is a very special situation
Hmm.
very distinct to Venezuela, that is that it doesn't have anything to do with the Cuban reality, with what happened in Cuba ehm, how I know, I know they
had to adopt that system eh, which were the necessities that got them to assume that system and, and what happened during the time in which
ehm, they were applying that because evidently there were mistakes in everything, like we also have mistakes right now
Of course, yes
We have been making mistakes, however, well it is being work on function of that, like the president says well ehm, clearly he has a claim against
the government, not against the the country but against the government from here that, that they are the ones that they
Of course.
well they assume some politics how would you say, how would you say it best, arbitrarily, ehm
yes, that I mean no, has been don, in reality, like the question says, the world's police, they are the ones that pretend to be
Exactly
bosses of everything and, and they tell you what is going to happen, and if you do not agree, well in a bad way, you, you, you have to agree with them
Exactly.  Correct, that is, and if not, then, I extort you you, you
Hmm. It is exact
Aha, then wow, ehm
With embargo, with, with everything there might be, or the worst ways, with violence, ouch, with war
Exactly.  Exactly, so it is a situation rather
This
delicate, but I believe and from what I have seen that the North American town is waking up in some way, I feel
Mm.
And there are a bit more people that are realizing what is really happening, because they have them like in a bubble
Still a lot is lacking, and that is what gives me more
Yes
It makes me mad because it is so clear to say if someone knows two plus two is four and one sees how they are manipulating the people
Clearly
And one, and those, and you intend to tell the other person, but look its like this, and this, and this. You don't realize? So they tell you no, because you are
liberal, or communist, or well you
Clearly
They give you these labels and
Some labels continue, bad ones, in passing
Bad, bad, if you are, eh, you are not a terrorist or you are anti, anti, leave, we don;t want you, if you don't like
Correct
And I say, but yes, eh, no this country, not bad they are not country, it is he the leaders of the country
Exactly, that is what they sometimes say to me, what are you doing here?
Yes
I say to him, look, I could be in Venezuela and not support the president or, the fact that you are in a
country or not, or you fled your country does not imply that you have a position
Mhm.
nobody knows the reason for the people being here
Ofcourse.
En, eh, in the opportune moment but that has nothing to do with the opposition because how many people, for example, in Venezuela they don't live in Venezuela and what they are doing is throwing them the enema
to the Venezuelan government and the town
Mm.
well, that you don't have to be here or there to support or not support well it is a position, to me, when they tell me that, it makes me laugh.
yes.
because. what do they do here? and well it may be the same thing you are doing thank God. That you are here and not in Venezuela.
No, but also in Spain it is the same what happens is that di- different the left government but even if it were right it is another mentality because the
town, when it is not agreed it is thrown in the streets and and they make manifestations and left here that is never seen, I have never seen it.
Correct, correct, no. Well with all the gasoline problems that have really been, well look
Oh. Mhm.
in a surprising manner, that the people can not, eh, no, they don't protest, I say, my God but what happens what happens with these people? well
Supposedly to you, when it affects your wallet is when you react but it looks like no, I don't know what happens, or they change their car and they buy a more economic car I don't know
yes.
I don't know what happens, but they don't have in general they don't have that necessity to protest under certain things
yes.
anyways I tell you, I don't know, all of a sudden here. You were in Pennsylvania you say?
Yes, Philadelphia yes
In Philadelphia. I don't know, but here I have felt that there is a little more, that like the people are like starting to wake up
Mm
I feel that they are rejecting the politics of, of, of the current president and, and like they are seeing that really things are not like they are painting them because
me too, I in the beginning like there was no I did not have access to that, to that page I would say, My God, could it be true what they are saying about Venezuela?  But I would speak with my friends
and they would tell me, no, gir, what is that?  Look And I, damn really, but look at the power of television is
yes
very big, well speaking precisely about the topic, power
Power, yes
and television is a huge power
yes, they are the ones that control, I mean, yes, here
Of course
ehm, Philadelphia is a democrat city, everybody is democrat, but the rest of the state is republican and of people well look, the anglo of, of, of the people that have things told to them
I don't know, very very ra-, very radical
Correct.
like that very religious, very closed, or if, then
yes, yes, yes, yes
No, can not, it is not going to change, so as long as that doesn't change, and then
Sure, sure, and what are you doing over there in Philadelphia?
I well I, with my husband here no mm We moved here one year ago, ago, before we lived in Florida and ehm.
Okay.
I'm looking for a job, we have, we just moved and
Oh, Â¿and do you think it's better there than Miami?
We are in the process of, um, well, i liked it better, the thing is that the, the work is better here on the north, at the south it's really saturated.
Ok, ok.
And, Â¿what are you going to do about it?, that's, work's first.
Right, right, and fi-, and you came here, Â¿And what do you do?
He is, is, he works at the pharmaceutical industry, doing clinical research uh
Ok, OK
And i, well, look, i do administrative work, uh, i volunteer and
Ok, and whatever goes, right.
well, whatever i can find, sure.
But, Â¿have you been living long here in the United States?
Well, twelve years.
Â¿Twelve?
Uh um.
Oh, dear mother. I have been here six years, and we're about to come back God permits.
yeah, when i got here, Bill Clinton was there, the country was in a, in an incredible period, a lot of work, everybody was happy, the economy was going up
Yeah, right.
then the republicans came, in, uh, with Bush, and everything went to hell, like they say.
Yes, sir, yes sir, and
It is todiendo little by little and is is don't know the world Spain is already
yes
when I go to Spain all the world to to my husband that is American they look at him and he tells me he has much resentment because he says look at your country is
the world is destroyed it is taking over everything and
Ay my God
they believe that yes they beleive they are you know the owners of everything
yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes
and there is power resentment
yes notice that before I used to be a little like that.and and today I understand that is not like that is like us because we do not have
fault of what our government does.
sure
Then before I also used to see the Americans like that like gringos well eh thst i understood that they are americans Unites States citizens because this is another concept they work no? then
Yeah
well we are also Americans if it comes to that
sure
and. and. then after that I start to reflect a little and no,no they are not northamericans no so it is the government politics what they do
they decide, then we sure it reflects against the town against the country
Mhm
but that is like that is the political state of goverment.
yes I don't like I'am Spanish and I am American I one here the need,and it seems like but me
Sure.
eh, and I have to persist and I have to deal with the government does, but on the hand I don't know, I don't like it, it's a
Sure, sure, yes, no, and you have, exactly you have your right, to be in the democracy, you have to the right to protest
Sure. Well, but theory, practice, you don't say anything, or rather that
I. Ah, yes, yes, I don't, I hope that this, it, it
Mm. It's like a dictatorship, yes.
It doesn't effect anyone, eh the project, this linguistic thing, but, well, at least it's an fairly controversial issue, when I heard
Very
the issue, I was just dying, so I said
I
Why? Why?
I say, I'm going to talk about Bush, because you see that I have so much, so much anger, I have to talk about Bush and put it bad because
But well, thanks to God, you're not alone. I listen to so many people that say it's not, they talk but they rant and rave about him and I say
yes, yes, yes
of course the people have realized, but aside of that
That is what
they think that the people are so dumb that they're not going to realize.
Mhm.
realize of the atrocities that they are doing, by God.
No, atrocities and later, and, and, the whole throws their hands above their head and exclaims, oh my God, that can't be, I don't know what
and no, by next week the forget about it because...
Sure
the press and TV, move on to something else,to,to distract, something to distract, then the people forget.
Sure, look, you know that a short while ago the Latin American film festival ended
Mhm.
and btw, they showed a movie, the Argentinian, but the directors were Spanish.
Mhm.
and then, really interesting, because you know that the Spanish film industry has many types of movies, and this one was a protest movie, sort of...
yes
documentary, where
Mhn.
Okay, my name is Ibet, With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with?
This is Mercedes.
Hello Mercedes, How are you? Where are you from Mercedes?
From Honduras.
Oh, Honduras?
Mhm.
Wow, I have a sister in law and she's from Honduras also.
Ah, where exactly?
Ay no, no Eh, I don't know, but I know that she is Honduranean as well.
Ah, that's nice.
yes, it is.
and where are you from?
I'm from Mexico.
Ah, Where? The city, eh, the capital?
From the city. yes, Mexico City. Yes. And
And what do you think about today's issue? That is it easier to break up with someone when you're young or, or if age makes a difference.
Mm, well, good. I've already passed that stage and I am married, but for example, ah mm, well I don't know. The experience that I had was, was very difficult
I feel that it's difficult when actually you love the person, when actually you don't lover her, I think that it's like everything else, okay, it's good, we break up, okay.
To each their own.
Yep.
then I believe that when you really love the person but in this case I imagine is because you did not get along with the person.
o o because I really do not know. maybe they did not want to get along between the between the two persons,I believe there should be ,more then nothing
communication in a relationship
Mhm
or between in the relationship, and if there is not one of the two pieces starts to loose the descon-there is going to be distrust and start
the communication deteriorates.then I believe this can can cause a break up but yes i know that I feel that it does hurt.
And did you ever have a break up that was hard
Mm well Eh really yes,yes,yes because for example,before I married my husband I was going with a person and for example, eh
same it was not a long time but the firs-eh my first boyfriend
yes?
then this one
is hard always.
it took me a small while with him with him it was not too the same but it was the first illusion i had, don't know and and I was already i had said well, and even said that no with him i will get married
eh I will have three children and I was putting my castles in the air and one time he came and said you know what? not me until it was over
How?
Mm
I believe there was I had more experience to say, until now everything is finished that I know to say eh then I beleive for him uhm
It was not very easy but for me yes.
Mhm.
And after today yes that.everything was for the best because then I met the one that is now my husband and wow and he is a lot better
The truth
How good
I don't know then
So, you have only had two boyfriends
That's right, and
How good. That's best. What for? Just looking for troubles
and you?
when ther is no need
yes, how did it happen to you?
Let's see, It's been long time since, eh, I don't think I ever had a difficult experience. Let's see, I think
Aha
with a boy I was with, oh, yes. With the first bpiyfriend I had, we stayed for about two years
aha
Mm. I remember we decided that then, I don't remember the exact reason, we would break up
aha
but that was ten years ago
wow
I was nineteen, eighteen, it was
Are you married now?
Yes
Oh.
And, afterwards we, well, we let ourselves be seen. Afterwards, that was not so difficult because we were apart, that is, he lived on his own and I lived on my own.
Aha. Aha.
After that, another boy that I went out with, we also had a few months also he didn't live with me, where
Aha.
we were, in university where we were and he returned to his country of origin
Aha
and that ones was also easy because you stop seeing him and quick-, I mean, it's easy, really
yes.
in that way.
yes.
Eh. What else? Let's see, which other. After that I didn't have any other formal boyfriend until S-, only, yes, the truth is that the experiences that I never had in a certain wa- experience that I don't even know, really? Thanks God.
Aha. No, yes, it's that sometimes, I don't know, well, for example, I think that in, in my case eh, with the first person that I fell in love too much
well, it was a lot
Mhm.
more than, than what eh, he loved me, I think, with me. And it wasn't too long, I think it was like two or three months.
Mhm.
But, all the same I was like flying because they said, ah, this is my first boyfriend and and probably I'm going to get married with him and things like that,
yes.
and in- and he, and he I think that he didn't think that way, he used to say well she, I don't know if I was his third, fourth, fifth, I don't know
so he said yes, well I'm not going to marry her, I'm going to be with her and get to know here and that's it. On the other hand, well I think, I think I was the one that was getting my hopes up because of that
and yes, to tell you the truth, yes it hurts,
Really
Eh, yes, it hurts because I think you are excited and have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and tells you no, well.
But I think that it must, it must hurt a lot more when you already live together like in a marriage.
yes.
I think it must be the worst experience, I think, of your life, yes, and I hope, I hope to never go through it because we never know, right?
Mm.
So I hope to never go through that, up to now, I've been married three years and everything is working wonderfully, but everything is fine
Thank God.
A lot of communication and things like that.
You also say that is nothing, everything can be perfect, is, true, always, and besides
yes.
because there are people that are mistaken there's people that think that, that marriage is, according to the stage and, and everything is peaceful
No.
But and you live with the person day and night and you see it
yes
is impossible well for it to remain Right? A situation like that that there is,
No, yes.
yes, you always love the person but is impossible for there to always be only peace, well that's what I'm saying, right?
yes.
Because one, well I, I am one, it is to be human and one has to, things that bother other people a lot, right? And
yes.
ve- to any other people, well i am not saying to the person in with that one is particularly, but any other person, well I know that
eventually, well like that, we have a saying, no, no it's a coin of the whole world, all day, the twenty-four hours of the day, for all the rest of the life, well
So it is.
yes.
yes, the truth I feel-, I think that it has to be something of the truth, eh very difficult, eh, to keep it so everything is happy, right? but
Mhm.
and I think that also that and I think that, eh, when you take your engagement, for example you can know and, accordingly, you go knowing the person
that, of course, you're not going to know thoroughly, right? until now you are married with that person but it's but I think that I think that
if you see that really you don't get along with that person and for example, I have known people eh, that they beat up their boyfriends being boyfriends, they beat them, and they abused and and they required them to everything that they wanted then
I think that those relationships well nothing is going to come from nothing good, because if they still aren't married
And to behave
and now they behave so imagine how it's going to be if they're goign to be married, no but in a little bit they're going to say you are my owner so now
yes. yes.
now like they treat her then I think that that a, that those relationships eh, I think that they're not going to work ever, I don't know. Or, or change him or
or change or end a relationship like that, I think that if it was a relationship like that, well, I I think that it doesn't have to hurt anything, on the contrary of
you have to think it over if you have a boyfriend that beats you or that
Mhm.
you're going to rest, you're going to say, ah, it's good we finished. I don't know. I thing that if for example everything starts doing it well and everything
everything is going well and suddenly someone, I don't know, must travel for example, to another country or has to go to another school, I think that that would hurt a bit
yes.
Because, everything is fine, but only the third circumstances, well, they have to separate. So, I think that this type of relationships, well that really really hurts, but if it's a relationship that
that they hit you and things like that no
Ah, no, yes, that. Bu-, and the, the, it's eh, ironic that Eh, those are usually, there are times that those are the most difficult relationships
for that, for people that are in-, involved in that type of relationship
That's true.
because usually, well eh, people are, when they are in that type of situation it's, there is like a very low self confidence
Aha.
and then they think that, people think that that's what, that's what's better that some times it's going to eh, what I'll be able to achieve
I have to endure, I have to keep on enduring, well
yes.
and then eh, really it's not as easy as one thinks to ah, he did that to me, I'm going to send him packing, no
That's true.
It's hard, rather, because uh, it's like no, it's like, let's not say an addict, but yes to the, to that type of situation that
the drama is al-, it's eh, very, true? and and then people don't know how to get out of that cycle of, of abuse, true?, that's what happens.
That's right, yes, it's true, you're right because
yes, but
for example one time I was in, while in Mexico, I met a girl that eh, one time she came by with dark glasses to her jo-, to work.
Mhm.
And I told her, and now you wear glasses? Was it a cloudy day,right? And she had a bruise that her boyfriend had made
Ah
And told her, you should, I told her, I think that you should not--,I don't know, I told her, but I think that you must not allow your boyfriend to touch you
because..., and she said, well it is very difficult to end my relationship with him. And I told her Why? And she said
I still love him
Mhn.
And then, wow, I told her What? How can you love a person who beats you? Sometimes she used to come bruised, and sometimes he..
Ah.
used to smack her and similar things
Ay, no
Therefore as sometimes you say those type of relationships are the hardest. And finally when she managed to do it I remember that she used to cry and cry and cry..
every time that she could, at every break and similar occasions because she missed him and all that. Therefore I think that yes,somehow sometimes
some relationships, I think that, I imagine that it was very painful for her.
Carolina
Fabiola
Â¿What's up, Fabiola?, Â¿How are you?, um.
Fine, Â¿and you?
Fine, fine. Â¿Where are you now?
In Washington, yeah.
Oh, dear mother, very far away.
Â¿And you?
I'm in Los Angeles.
Ugh
Yeah
Extremes
We're just on the on opposite sides. That's good; and, Â¿where are you from?
Chilean
Â¿From where?
Uh, Chilean, from Chile.
Oh, Chilean. Ok, I'm from Venezuela.
Â¿From Maracaibo?
No, you know, I'm not. Â¿Why, do you know people from there?
Yeah, i know some people from Maracaibo.
oh, yeah, yeah. Well, you know that they have a stronger accent. Right? like, look and you. Mm
Eh, yes, yes.
Yeah,
look and you, are you arepa?
A, yes, yes, yes. And how great, that's great. Because sometimes it very difficult to find Venezuelans, and they say no, no, in fact we know very few Venezuelans, this and that and I, uh, my God.
We are very few here in fact. But, in about a, mm, about, mm, ten years maybe, I think it has increased.
yes.
Mhm
I know, yes, I young woman from Venezuela, in Houston.
Mhm, oh. Do you work at the Hilton?
No, no, no, no, no. In Houston, in
Oh, I heard in Hilton. Oh, my God, oh okay, okay.
Texas. No, no, no. I work at home. In my house.
Okay. Okay. perfect.
Do you work?
Yes, I work with deaf children.
oh,
Yeah, well, now, in fact, I am working with the parents of the deaf children. Mhm.
What a great job.
Listen, yes. Very strong work.
yes, But, eh, it satisfies you having
yes
having power to help people
Exactly, exactly, and i was doing the same in Venezuela, only that i was using the sign language.
I learned the alphabet there in, ah
Ah, ok, ok, Chilean off course, no ?
I learned, yes
Mhm
But, with signs
Mhm, correct. But, here is oral.
Oh, here my daughter taught me the alphabet, eh, and some words
Okay
Not all of them, some like "I love you" and other
Mhm
yes, small words
Mm, okay
But, pretty
yes, yes, now I'm with the first oral part. No ? I'm like at the other end of, mm, from mm,
of the profession. Because this is an, here the children are given incentives to talk
How ? To talk ?
Mhm.
Without listening, but, talk, do-
yes, no, yes. Because they, mm, with auxiliary earpieces, are able to listen in.
Ah.
Then, what you do, is that they train aurally so that they can recognize the sounds.
How beautiful.
Mhm, mhm. yes, yes. That is like, like a possibility they have, well, to be able to speak clearly. They will never be able to speak perfectly, him, you, you will feel the difference as her speak.
But, they will definitely have that option, since. That even in, eh, it's - there are some parents who combine, sign language with the oral part. No? Depending on,
depending on the grade of the auditory loss of, of, of the child. If it is very profound, wherein there are no possibilities even with the best operation, then, there
eh, we utilize sign language as complement.
what a hard job for parents.
Mhm. It is great work, truthfully. It is very, very hard. But, it is very, eh, rewarding. Well, in the end, eh, you have your, your reward, well. Of course, you have to realistically put on, well like we say, put on the batteries.
Because, in another form, mm, well, hardly, well, they are going to achieve it, well.
What is your opinion on the topic that they gave to us today about-?
Well, you see, it a candle topic. Candle, candle, truly. I think that the relationships between partners are not at all simple. You have to fight with a person that,
that is different from you, that comes from another world, another culture, another way of being, and, then attempt to have a single project, like,
eh, sometimes it is a bit difficult. No? But, I think that love is the only thing that makes it possible for barriers to be overcome, more than anything.
Only if there's, if there's love and if there's a lot of disposition from the partners so that those, those differences and those, mm, those, eh, tiffs that can be had at any moment,
they overcome themselves. you think so?
yes. Of course. I think suddenly more of love and all of that. Because, love is like is,
Mmh.
it is acquired with time.
Of course.
And, and with, and with enthusiasm.  Then, I believe that you want to maintain your family, you have to want to keep a family because there are very few people who love.
Mmh.
And, thy are so young,  that the first thing that occurs to them when they have the opportunity, fight, split up.
Correct.
They don't work hard.  And, they love each other, and they love each other maybe even more than a couple who has been married for 30 years.
Of course.
But, they struggle day to day and they overcome problems, they go above problems.
Correct.
And, this is what I believe that they need mm, people nowadays, have patience and no-
yes.
to think that if they decided to stay with that partner, or marry that partner,
Of course
well, it is forever already.  Though there are problems, not to go running after the first problem that you found.
Of course. Well, see that I with mm, my husband, we ave, we are going to reach eight years of marriage,
And, I twelve.
and, twelve, imagine.  And, and, really we have had, well, two critical moments, critical, to the point of nearly separating.  And, and, there was a point when maturity, there, plays an important role, No?
yes.
In another moment in my life I'd have done it.
Me too.
aha
But I had done nothing important.
I hadn't done nothing important either, nothing. But, look I don't see a damn thing.
ah, yes as I said stop me if I fall. What is the problem?
Exactly.
But now I think three things.
I understand. But right now is that true what you think and say, no but he has other things. That, me , I'm focused on the good things that he has, I say he is different from me, he can't think like I can and it doesn't bother me if he doesn't think like me.
But, also that, I don't want to let it affect me.
Ah, I understand. I feel the same as well.
No? I understood exactly. But, unfortunately, good, the first was horrible because I thought that it was the end of the world. And good, I felt, and waited a long time that one day we tried while I thought it was a good day but is that what's happening?
We have, we were married three weeks. we had almost gone  three weeks. Never in life had we lasted three weeks without seeing each other-without hablarnose. And sleeping in the same bed
Oh my god
Mm horr-, horrible horrible. I said look, do you understand this? So it seems.
I haven't touched it. It hasn't come to that.
hey, it's not that bad, it's very rude on our part, in reality. He said you know what? To me I think that this is full of crap.
It does not have to make sense. If you want to continue with the project, we will continue it. If you do not want to continue, we won't continue it. I love you,
I love you. But this can't continue, because you go for a day and I go for the other. And the truth, I think that I love you. And that's why I love you.
is this what I need to define it this way. Why, it's insensitive on our part, to live this way. Besides, in this way I don't believe in God. So what.
We will working on it. Because, irrespective of how serious may be the situation, that luckily wasn't so serious but that neither side wanted give in. right?
It was pride
Fool pride. Because, that
yes, it's up to nothing
to nothing. But the opposite
it only affect
Exactly, then, well, fortunately we are back on track. And then after, we had another, however, this was smaller. I think the first one was the one which really left us marked
And, it went well, well, furthermore, I was ready, I was ripe for the picking, as we say here. I said, stop, I've got this fair
ripe for the picking is like ready to throw in the towel
yes. Ready to throw in the towel. I said, nothing, no no no, I'm not going to co- Not going to allow it, I say. I'm not allowing you to do it, i mean, you're wrong
If something I learned from this life, is to search for solutions to problems than can be solved
Sure
Cause, What are we going to do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre relationship. As you yourself says, there are people whom spend thirty years together and that's a crap of a relationship
yes?
That, whom trat each other bad. This, look, this piece of don't know what thing, what, what's that? Why would I want it?
Mm. No is- a girl, and sometimes they treat each other well, but they don't love each other
Exactly, that too
They are, they spend all their lives together
yes, yes, yes. Look, Is that a thousand things happens, really. Couples go through so much that is, is an interesting topic. Because, you say,
That truly there is people, whom look, they like a lot each other, but not love each other. Like, well I got accostumed to live with him
Right? They respect and, and,
Exactly.
and, what they wanted to form was a family, and so.
Exactly. There are others that don't. There are others that definitely they do whatever they feel like and they keep up an image.
Right? And, they are others that say, love, If there's no love, there's nothing.
There's nothing, there's nothing.  It's true that there has to be a big, big love. That's why I'm telling you, because I feel that in my relationship, what was possible was love.
Because truthfully, with a situation that was so difficult, like we were living, if there hadn't have been love, it would have, no, we would have broken up, just that simple. Because it just wouldn't have made any sense.
It doesn't make any sense to continue something that, eh, where's there no love. Well, I feel that yes. A lot of love, and many of his promises that you were talking about, to actually love.
To be here because you want to be, because it was worth it.
Because, sure, because nobody is forcing you. You want to be here, and, and you fight. And in order to maintain yourself,
Exactly, exactly.
You could have a couple, it's difficult. And when you have it, you have
Exactly.
The hardest, after, is to keep it going.
Sur- that's the hardest. Yes, sir. And, to seek, how to be constantly in that eh, eh, in that harmony that, that, like new things, that we're going to do differently, let's do, not slip into a routine.
Eh,
But, no. It's that as time goes by, you know, but, the important things is that you can not leave her.
Exactly, sure. I recognize that.
And that the system will also bring you to that conclusion.
Of course. Of course. Your husband is also Chilean?
No, he is from here.
Uy, imagine.  Like, eh, it is a little more.  I mean, it is not that it is more difficult.  Actually, I feel that love can do anything.
So easy, I say.
You think it is easier?
and, eh, well, for certain things, easier.
Oh, OK, OK.  Because, my husband is Venezuelan and,
For certain
and sometimes, I say, I believe that, that has nothing to do with, with nationality.  I believe that those are universal things.
yes, I believe that for me it is easier because sometimes, the, the are very entertaining because I don't understand everything he says or he says it fast, then it doesn't go well, no, no, fighting had no point
a lot with him, because it makes me laugh.
And, what, what was that you said?
what do you say? Or when we are very
Bad.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, hello, how are you?
Good, I am Viola of Idaho.
Ah, of Idaho very good. I'm Alicia of Atlanta.
Of Atlanta.
Yes.
Oh, how are you?
Good, and you?
Good, good.
that's good, where are you from originally?
Of Chile.
Really? Me too?
For real?
yes.
Oh, that's good.
that's funny
And how long did you live there?
yes. Well more or less in the for example I'm there all two thousand three.
oh, okay
and what you call it, of course then I would come and go but more or less in ninety one, yes. And you?
I've been living here since two thousand two.
Ah, is not that long,  for nothing, for nothing.
not it hasn't been that long, it's been a short time
And from Santiago probably
yes, from Santiago.
Of course.
And and you, where are you from?
Oh, I lived.
From Santiago also?
Of course, I lived there in Santiago and in Concepcion.
Oh, okay
Sure,
Look what, what a small world.
yes, precisely. Sounds good.
And have you been in this thing a long time? This thing of calling on the phone?
Because no, I don't know of what. I registered Monday to do
oh yes?
And i didn't know anything so far, from
Â¿Hello?
I mean hello, yeah.
Oh, ok.
Oh, i wish it wasn't this phone, it's kinda bad, but sometimes
Oh, ok.
No, but i was saying that I've been taking calls, i don't know.
Oh, Â¿you're, uh, you're calling every day?
Well, sure, i started once, and i got four calls, but i could only take one.
Oh, ok.
Yes.
Yes, yes, i got called this week too but i couldn't answer
Well, uh
this week, I've been kinda lazy
Right, yeah, well, sure
Yeah
I'm telling you, it's been
Yes
Fun, they give you a subject to
To talk about, to have something to talk about, i think
no ah, it must be
yes, i think so
I thought, I thought this study was to make a phone menu and stuff like that
Eh
so, for hospitals, theaters and stuff, people wanted to talk about things about health and stuff. for example
No, it's just so happens that I was told that matters were so because you have to talk about personal things
Ah, because you should not or because you do not want to do?
because you should not, like personal things
Ah,
but you never know if another person is on the phone
Ah of course, ah, OK
so, that's why they give you subjects to have to talk about
Ah, ok, I thought it was part of the study, they wanted to hear words in Castilian and Spanish, I don't know
oh okay
no but no
All they told me was that I had to talk about issues of importance
of course with
have a theme, don't talk as a pure head of sin
of course, is the fruit
so if what
Yes
This.  Yes, you like it here?
No, no, of course Idaho is good.
Ah.
Yes, I was in Washington near Seattle when I came to the United States, of course.
Ah,
And now I'm in Georgia, I'm in the south, so it's as good here as it is for everyone there, and I'm in Atlanta
So even more to be posted there
Ah
But Idaho, for example is really rural, whereas here it isn't.
Yes, it's like the countryside, everything is really just the countryside
Yes, I would imagine myself there, why not, it depends
Yes, it's like how there isn't much nightlife there, I don't know
I bet.  The thing is, being in Atlanta, it's a pretty big city.  Supposedly life should be really great here, you see.
In two or three years
Ah,
And also, all the stores and the bars and the clubs need to close at 2 in the morning.
Wow, at 2.
At 2 in the morning, everything is closed.
Oh, and why
So the the reason is that is has the the sector like like the and that in Atlanta it is called Bucks Head
ehm.
and like, and already like two, three years ago there were some crimes and things, and three people were killed. They killed her three persons.
Oh.
Around there, then the city On top of the new major what do I know, then yes that the people well are killing the
Oh
but the same is but it is like is like yes, a city like that has to have by obligation
yes, well.  And like but over there do people use any cars or is there more like public?
Oh, it is not of many cares, too many cars, yes
we, oh well the same because to go out at two am is not that
well it is that
if you have a car or something like that
sure.  It is not that the bad thing is that for example I would prefer one thousand times to have a a system so so good for the simple reason of the problem the
expensive and on top of that
yes
a lot of congestoin.
Oh, okay
the, sure it is like a horrible traffic, that is delay like to any place yes like
yes
yes, the car
Here is totally different.
Oh, yes, like over there.
Well, there are so many cars. People have cars, everyone, because it's a necessity, something like that.
Of course.
because there is no bus. But,
Oh,
are, like, don't, don't take too long, to go to so many places, to the city, where I live, is like half of Santiago's port there are much less people, because.
Yes, well.
because you knew that here, things are like, since the houses are much bigger, they are further apart, things like that.
of course, of course, they are in or
And no, I am in Idaho, Falls
ah, yeah, yeah,
In Idaho, falls
yeah,
In, I am going to a much larger city, then
mm
There in a much larger city, but
Of course
Where we are no, is country
Ah, how great, is the same like, of course. Eh, and gave a thing over there like this one, this one, the one that The Washington University
Ah
we were Latinos and
No here is a lot of machines, that's for sure
ah ready
A lot of Mexicans and it is more a rural place
Mm
They hire a lot of Mexicans to work in
ah
the land and things like that
oh, sure
then almost all people you see is mexican. Also if the people see you they think you are Mexican
Sure, yes, yes
at least latinos, they say ey Mexican
Sure, the wheat
then you are telling, no, no, no
no
i am not Mexican
Sure, what i like a lot is when they believe that i am Palestinian or asian, if i go to some restaurants
yes
yes, like from middle east, they tell me
Ehm.
and they try to talk to me in Arabic, I don't know.  They think I have more of of of an Indian face or something like that but of cuorse, and is there discrimination over there or not?
Uhm uhm yes, the same, but not the same
oh, but
That is yes, like everywhere else
ah, sure
the same, is that more than anything it is with people that are Latin but don't know much speak but
ah, sure
because there are a unch of people just the same that go to buy and don't know anything about
And sure, sure
English so and then they have to walk no but people just the same, you know like everywhere else, they are sort of
yes. yes. Sure
because over there they are very discriminating, you know that
Well over here is like super today Atlanta and all of the south is like sixty pr cent black, like that.
Oh, okay
So it is like, the fact that it is more diverse like that it is like much more ehm, acceptable I don't know but at the same time to the south is the south of the
United States has that history of being one of the more racist places of the whole United States, in fact here
Oh,
There was slavery and all of that, then. The same over there a a certain minority of Whites that hate any ethnic group and have their strange demonstrations and all of those things, but
Ah, but things strong like that, yes.
ofcourse.
They fight strong
yes but.
Here no, it's not something massive it's not like something semi heavy but no no like group things like that no
of course for example in the rural parts of Georgia they saw things like were seen in the Ku Klux Klan I don't know
oh yes, really
yes, still
oh, mm
and that those rare things but they are are very very far the city
Eh.
it is inside the city of Atlanta one is in a place more civilized and so those thigs no
Eh.
yes by luck, look what was happened
Oh. Oh, how strange
And how did you get to iadho like that?
Oh I married a gringo
Ah, ofcourse. A Idaho
yes. I was married to a gringo, that's how I came here. and you how, how
Well my mother married a gringo
Oh yes?
Yes, because of that we came we went to Seattle in ninety one, I had Eleven years.
Mm.
but my dad stayed in Chile and that is why I come and go like that.
Oh. okay
Clearly.
Mm. okay
And a
Okay
interesting.
So now you are single?
Something like that, I am like we live together.
Oh, okay
Of course clearly.
okay Ah, mira. ?And, and what do you call it do you like it or not?
Yes, because or its like I am in the city, I like it more city because of, I am from the city or the countryl. For example I lived in San Rafael I don't know if you're familiar but
He walked from San Felipe to the Andes which is in the question more more rural and you couldn't imagine how
Oh.
typical Chilean country and that enchanted me.
yes
Like a valley, what do I know. Oh, I like to be in the city because it is it is more hip, what do I know, there are more things to do
But I don't know, this makes me
ah
then
oh, esta bien
yes
It's not like
but
well it's a super drastic change for me to come here
yes, I imagine
Because I was accustomed to live in the city, and here, But there is a city near I could find all I need but the life is more
Is more calm, just saying
sure
More calm and everything, just it is not good because for example eh, There is not so much crime as in a bigger city  grande
sure
But is kind of bored
yes, I imagine
Kind of
but the same in touchm is hard too
here. Yes, it's the same but not too much. Like at least Chico is not that Big
Well.  Oh.  Hello, Juan.  Marcela
Hello.  How are you?  My name is Juan.  Marcela.
yes.  How is it going?
Listen didn't we talk the other ay with?
I think so.  You are in Texas and I am in North Carolina.
yes.  I.  Pleasure.
Yes, pleasure.
I have not forgotten you.  Did we practice together, no?  yes.  Listen, but I am tocan, health.
yes.
Do you have social security here?  Are you covered?
Eh, I am covered through my husband.
Uh uh.
And the children are covered like that so we are alright.
Ah, well we.  We are not.
It is a problem, no?
We are not covered.  It is a problem because well something can always happen, no?
Mm. We are very healthy but you never now.
And him yes.  And the other day I went precisely I went to an ah office in which supposedly they gave you some type of I mean pension for
people like that in the community, no?
Yes.
And well already the papers that they asked with my address and proof of work.  And, finally they found an excuse to to not, to not give it to me because they asked
me to give information about the person who was hiring me and in that moment because the person didn't want to give out the information, no?
Mm.
And and, in my case I have a son who has epilepsy.
Ah.
And, then he needed some kind of tension of emergencies here things that
And they didn't give you, eh, the attention?
eh, no.  No, no.  They didin't want to describe me.  Really.  Then in the cases if I price with him, he was sick one time.  He got worse.
And then I had to, to go back.  to Mexico and that there he got attention from a doctor who sees him.
Mm.
And they prescribed him and then already once I ran out of medication.  Eh, normally I buy it in Mexico and
yes, but it can be cheaper.
it is a problem with the prescription and then a friend who is a doctor had samples and he gave me medical samples
yes, that helps.  what a thing.
no? yes he gave me.  Then yes, it is something that we think that well there should be some kind of more flexible, no, so if there is a community but it is a certain kind of community.
yes.  No, I think that the whole system is going to have to fall before they do something different.  Because I think that it is too difficult to fix it because there are
the costs of, the costs of everything, depend on demand.  And then if these costs are rising, rising and rising
yes. yes.
because there is more demand and because people pay it.  And then they raise the costs because people ask more and more money and people who work ask for more money, it is ia vicious circle.  And then how can suddenly they can have socialized medicine?
yes.
It is impossible because all of that people already are like
yes.  It should be
Money does not stop being like a drug, you see.  They are already used to a certain amount of money.
Uh uh
And then now, suddenly they are not going to have it.
Exactly.  It is a problem, it is a circle that works with the earnings here it is stronger, isn't it?
yes.  Of course it is.
Then the interest is more ugly
We would stop making bombs and going to war.  Look, all of that money that could be used
Mm
for schools or on a medical system, of social medicine
Mm.  Mm.  Well, if they would lower it just a little bit.
Mm. yes.
with that.  Because over here I don't know over there where you are living.  But, here if somebody has money it is the nurses and the doctors.  Isn't it?
yes, well nurses are paid very well because few nurses you know there are less
Then,  Mn.  And Well so here Like that as they say, time a good care with a woman that is around thirty years old, for example, no?
Mm.
And is a nurse and like that it passes.  When you find out if they really are nurses.
yes.  Tell me, twenty, thirty dollars an hour.
yes, yes, to me  Uh uh  Then h ere in this case well like it does get offered.  In Canada it is my understanding well they have much medicine, isn't it?
Mm
Then any Canadian resident has rights to medical services, just to be there and they don't have any economical consequences
No, bu  the difference is that they started right
Yes, Exactly
It's like Argentina, my parents have all the medical bills paid
Oh
All medical coverage is paid, they pay a little amount, not so much
Yes, this is one thing we should make, at least paying something
yes
having some type of social security, but even that is really
yes, its really expensive
It's expensive right?, I don't know how drugs are her, but, well, in Mexico is cheaper
all over the world, All over the world
And there is more competition there in drugs. That's weird
Yes, there was a drug my son was taking there, and well, when we moved here we couldn't find it
Oh
So, we went to Argentina last year, I went to the drugstore and something you pay more than 50 dollars here
i bought it there for 12 dollars
yes, yes
12 dollars, same company and everything
yes.
And it could have been less if I bought the other brand, the unknown brand.
Same. yes.
But I don't understand.
And in the case of Mexico, for example, my son's medicine there's like five, six brands
Mm.
with similar ingredients
Mm
No? yes, ye. And here there's only one. And second that in the literature is not the best. And listen but only the laboratories, I thought that all the American laboratories well
so at the time of competition well here there's a monopoly.
yes, yes, yes.
Big interest in everything, no?
That's true. It really is true.
Mm.
I mean I, according to things like this
But
according to what specialty they have to operate here. You know what you would have to do?
yes.
Why don't you contact an organization that is called the Shriners?
Mm, mm. oh yes.
Shriners yes.
Yes, I already know, I already know.
Eh, because they help the children.
Mm.
Now I don't know if they specialize in a specific disease. Or if they cover everything because perhaps
Mm.
You can communicate with them and say to them, he hears we have this boy and this is his condition and this is our situation.
Yes.
And perhaps they can help in some way. Because the Shriners are dedicated to helping, to paying for the medical care of children. That they can't pay.
Uh uh. Uh uh. Then yes he sees, yes.
of the parents who can't pay.
Yes he knew of that. He hears, what already it was time or what?
What I know, they say that it is twelve minutes but the twelve minutes seems like half an hour.
Ah. I noticed that. Yes I only knew and thought it was for me. And I much smaller without you tiring and for more style
Yes. Perhaps uncertain but not to find out you see it cost nothing.
Mm. I am going to crash.
And also if you call to Catholic Charities
Uh. Uh uh. That yes.
Perhaps they, perhaps they have what I know, a wave or something you see that it can help you in
yes, yes it's very simple because in reality, good on the one hand the maintenance is a medicine that this person who helped me with the sample says no man this
here they give them to us, you have no problem. Just go to some community center or something and
Mm.
there are many samples. And, but knowing a bit more about the advances is that I can give the medicine that we think that a deeper diagnosis could improve the life of my son with
with the epilepsy, no?
Sure.
because it was under control but lately it has been nearly two years in which it has been uncontrolled. It has been out of control.
Mm. And of course he's growing up and then maybe that medicine doesn't work anymore, they have to give him another one.
And, well, he gave me, he gave me yes. Yes, they gave him another one. The potentialized it and it didn't sit well on him and then. Well, what can you do, he had to stop using it and return to the basics.
Mm.
Yes, yes, we was very ill
what a thing.
yes, yes, well so you know, it's a matter of experimenting.
And you, you must live with your hearts in your mouth.
Well yes, sometimes yes.
and that causes a lot of stress.
Always yes.
Much stress
the life even if you don't say it your always looking after him, all the time.
Mm. yes, yes. yes.
no? Afterwards you know that, you're always hoping that id doesn't happen. Well, I don't know that that it happens really no. But well that's a trauma but my poor son because he's a teenager so
Mmm..
It happens at school so he feels really bad
Of course, he is ashamed, How old is he?
Yes it is a heavy load, it's a really heavy load for him.
How old is he?
17
Oh, it's just a teenager
Yes..Hey, getting back at subject, I think there must be a a good ones her
Yes, Do you know where you can ask?, At teachinh hospitals
System of
At medics, at teaching centers in medical schools
Oh
At those place plenty of times at different apartments
Yes
They check people who can't afford a normal consultation. They   take care of people like us who can't afford an specialized doctor
Mm
And we do not have
Oh, I see
And they take note of whatever they give us, and after that they charge
a reasonable account. Something we can afford, sometimes they don't even charge at all
Hmm
Of the month. And that, that's interesting. I had to get an abscess checked. It turns out I have something called ADD
yeah
And a few years ago I thought I had it, but in the end I went and I had kind of self-diagnosed, and in the end I found here the teaching hospital of the University of North Carolina
Yeah
and they didn't charge me anything and they performed all the tests on me
ah, really?
yes
So everything is very well, to which orientation are we going, right, in fact, the place I went to precisely is called University System, healthcare system or something like that but
Ah, yes, then it's that with the
Then it's precisely there where they bounced me
with the University, eh?
I told him
Ah, but what a thing
Mm. Uh uh. then, they told me no, you have to give us information. I had a letter with my earnings, and so on, no?
Mm.
But, not that, we need the social security of your employer. And then that's when they didn't want to anymore
They didn't want to give you that information.
no? but not me. But well, now I have my social security, myself.
Oh, then maybe now you can
Yes, employed
Mm.
Well, maybe I'll go.
Maybe now you can
Uh uh.
hello how are you? my name is John
hi, good eh, matt here
i am in san antonio Matt i think we have spoken before you are in Philadelphia
yes and you are
oh look its a placer talk with you again
yes, how have you being?
hey, everything is fine what do you think about today theme?
no i didn't listen what is the theme?
the theme is the technical devices, i mean the technology, the devices that you use more and you depend of them how do you consider these dependency
and how consider the technology question no? in your daily life, if it become more in a problem than in a solution or something like that
This include cars?
its the same issue that i was thinking, sure they must added no?
yes because it is a machine you know
exactly so, yes if the cars seems to be so important  no then i thought better is a computer bu no
yes the most obvious its the computer, but its not the only one
OK exactly but sometimes seems like a personal element depending of the case, so  it can be a car no because the computer is a tool every time more
so more than once, we said that belongs to the institution where you are no? its more than a tool work
oh
but that tool is very personal seems like a car no?
yes that's why the same things you buy a car and always you are using it and always you have to mantained, always its a part of your life
why, do you need to look after the car yes, do you know ?
yes yes, exactly, besides as I'm here in Texas
ah
I feel that the automobile culture here is like a reminiscence of the culture of the horses too
did you used the horses more ?
no ? it is like a horse, it is something like, very very very personal, very close
yes
over the course of one's life, here we take care of them and it's very important just like a horse from that time, no ?
yes
for some years yes, because if they say no the devices that have to do with communication are the most important in our age, like computers
eh, as permitted by the information management and everything, no ?
yes, because, here in Texas yes, because up here in Texas
but
you need the car, do you know ? for work
yes
then
exactly and here the working people are like in those days, like mules no ? they need a pickup truck
ah? yes, yes
pick up truck, no ? give and do not leave, if you notice like there's a work culture that's very, very important
i see
and the computers, okay, well in all houses there is television, telephone and computers practically, no? but but like that there are other dimensions, no? of the technological question, then the car seems to be
the most most important
yes but, , the questions on the subject were which
ah, what a- what technical question, technology is most important in your life? what is that which we are discussing right now if it would have to be the car or it would have to be the computer, what do you think?
well, for me it would be more my computer and my cellular telephone
uh huh, exactly
because, you know? because I have my cellular and I'm always with it
uh huh
and, okay I have become accustomed to having a cellular telephone, you know?
uh huh
before, I didn't have a cellphone until I was like twenty years old, but now that to, that I live in Philadelphia in the city and that I'm not always at home for-
I'm not always going back home for for, you know? to look at my messages
yes, yes
okay always always I am, always I have my cellphone
you have your cellphone
I think that it's very it's like surprising that almost everybody has a cellphone, here in the United States
, yes notice that yes, it's very important what you've just said, a while ago when I worked I had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important, no?
yes
and well, in the computer there were the messages, always it was in the internet, the mail more than the telephone, neither cellphone nor anything, no?
yes
The computer was the most important.
But now,
But now, With the type of work that I`m realizing the auto is the most important. the computer, because the auto is what let you, re-e-el Type of work that I`m doing is more.
More physical. no? Then the auto is converted in the ins- in the apparatusmore important and the computer, for a second diagram, also is very important.
But of course is by the type of good work.
Well, for me I think, very well, yourself and, yourself was working for Texas and obviously you know. There is more, hm. How you say? I undertand that there is more like lands and someplace there. understand?
Way more space
yes,yes
For in the city having a auto it can be convenient as well.
yes,yes, that yes.
Because always you have to try to park and to have to pay a lot to park, and the gas station is not close by and, I do not know it.
Is more one problem that one torque, that one help obviously. Understand?
oh, yes?
It is better to have an auto hm I think.
Yes hm, yes. no maybe here yes, for the distance that needs to go in the job, the auto is fundamental.
aha, clear.
But yes in, in the city I think yes, the most important and depends in the job also,so, hm maybe it can be a computer. no? Then.
The, the next question or, or the apparatus of communication.no? How you say, the cellular and....
aha.
And that, and hm, and the other question is if you consider that those hm, these technologies will convert more into a problem than, than in....
well, what type of problems would it have, no?, like you just said, with the car, the problems that have to do with parking
aha
no?, here in Texas there is not, is not, where I am there are no major problems, no?, with parking there is a lot of space everywhere no, it still does not have the
let's say, those problems here, but but in the end, I don't know, I don't know what you think, above, above everything i would say that, well in regard to the care, issues with cars and all of that well like it is not seen as a large problem unless it is
we could consider as a problem the interests created around the, the auto industry and like sometimes they seem to affect the same technology development of the
of transport, no?, for example
aha, but don't you think as well that it is, that it is very like great that that has changed like in sixty years?
yes
s-o we look how seventy-five years in the past there were no cars, but these days almost everybody has
yes yes,, yes but, yes
and the same thing with the computers they have, they have computers that are not going to let come out to the market until, like ten years, because
since
because they have th- the things very advances and the things have not ___ have not _____
yes
gotten paid for their development costs, you understand me?  I don't know how to explain it very well but
exactly yes, well as they say as well, with the auto industry, no? is the auto industry would have advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry maybe the car could transport us with
one hundred kilometers with only one liter of gas
aha
no?,, and instead of costing let's say twenty thousand dollars, it would cost you two thousand dollars
yes
If that was the case, no? but, like technology, in this case industry, it has its own interests, it, like, moves on, you know what they're talking now about hybrids
that, at lot of them say that they are not affordable, that it's really a matter of image that companies do, and when it comes to see the, the return tables
of the hybrid cars, well, I though they would be a lot more efficient, but I think what they've achieved is a minimal efficiency
yes
no? no, I don't think they have a real, hmm, that they are a really big technological breakthrough, given the efficiency that
yes, that was a very important breakthrough
excuse me?
you don't think it's an important breakthrough
no, I don't think it's so important, taking into account that the efficiency they show is not radically different from the other cars', I mea
ah
according to the tables, an economical car will give you maybe thirty-six miles per gallon
yeah
and a Hybrid can give you fifty
no, ah, yes, there are cars now like, like the Ford cars
uhm, well
the pickup well the pick up trucks no because they are changing them so they can be more efficient, you know?
aha
but, but the expedition and those huge cars and that spend like that, you know? it can only run like around twenty miles, eighteen miles per gallon something like that, that is a huge expense
yes exactly and and sure, and but, at the same time for example with those autos of ehm, there have been small cars that give you almost the same mileage than the hybrid, and they are not hybrid, isn't it?
by, small cars, new that are not in the Northamerican market, that are in the European or Latinamerican market where they have to be much more efficient.
oh, yes
and smaller, no?  so if we compare the costs of a hybrid against a smaller European car, or or of teh ones that circulate in Latinamerica so then
no- it is much more expensive to have a car which is because of the initial cost and why it will be saved a lot in in gas, it ends up
being less than to what a car has, a good economy car, no?
and, why is it that
European
why is it that the United States is one of the few nations that has this, that, only here you have those huge cares, you know?
yes, it is, yes
over there in other countries everybody has small cars that well,, different, different culture you know? but
yes I, precisely, years ago when there was the problem with petroleum, in the eighties or something like that, I recall
ah, aha
I thought that it there was going to be a change in the culture, because they started to, to develop smaller cares here in the United States.
yes, but
I thought well, there is going to be a change in the culture, but that was a thing of only the moment, no?  it seems because it has some huge cars, they continue like
I'm Ana Maria
Ah Faviola, hi
Hello Faviola
How are you?
Fine and you? How's the weather there where you're at?
Great, it's sunny but cold.
Sunny and cold, ah.
Cold
It's bad here, it's really cold here. What do you think about movies? Have you already talked about that subject?
yes
I've talked about that subject before too.
Yea I've talked about it and I've talked about the uh, one I remember specifically talking about was about violence.
mhm
that it, that they didn't like the idea of going to see movies. And I told them, that the world that the world is, it has violence
mhm
It's always had it, and I've had the chance to teach children about peace and love with the TV or, or in the world and later when they go out into the real world at school.
They find that, that kids hit each other, that they don't know how to defend themselves. Especially when you have only children.
uh huh
so uh, I think that it's OK that they rate the movies how they do, I think it's the responsibility of adults, even where their kids can watch TV.
I agree, the respon- the most important responsibility of parents.
They are doing their job them of the movies and
They are earning their money, what is your job.
it's his business, you
doing his business, yes
yes today the one that wants, the one that wants to see, he doesn't want to see him anymore it is not their responsibility, they see
of, yes
that they sell
yes
It is what they do, it is not their fault, it is the fault of those that buy it
yes, of who likes the product, because of that
yes
with you it is the maximum responsibility, if it is violence, sex, whatever it is protect a child. The biggest responsibility is of the parents, even with classification
Because there is a classification of a movie for example -PG thirteen
yes
And you have a small child of that age and you let him watch that movie it is your responsibility
yes
It is because you let him and you thought what can be done. Isn't it true?
Exactly
Then because I the the the association, o, o, o, whatever it is they one who puts the classifications already has it then
I believe yes, we believe more or less the same thing in that Faviola because in the end the responsibility of raising, taking are of and wanting them to see or not see
Your sons, or your family.  eh, You as a mother or your husband as a mother.
mm I believe also that I agree completely and the other, normally the children have access to television when the parents are out.
Exactly
the kids are alone
mhm
And there is not father to teach them or tell them, you should not watch this, you should watch
Or if they go to a sleepover, you don't know either
Sure, no because you don't have any idea
If they go to a sleepover and the watch a movie, they watch a movie and they don't have any control at that house, or whatever
You don't know either
Exactly
I believe it is important to give to your children one, that they respect those, signs if yone give them good principles at home.  One as a famly, then teach them, things
Sure
That really I don't like or why I don't like.  You watch, or you are nor ready, or the time will come
What, because as they say, they cannot have them in a crystal box
No, and also
go, exposed
yes, also when the children reach certain age.  Mi son was fifteen, sixteen, seventeen years old and he tells me, don't worry, because you did better than you could do
mhm
ah, it is twenty five percent genes and education, the rest is the decision, the decision of my life
Look, with that that
Of course, then I learned. Oh wait, no eh, oh, I was and
mm
My cellphone was ringing. Okay Okay let me answer.
okay
eh, don't hang up on me because we have to talk for twelve minutes.
yes
The I only went to turn it off.
Okay ah
And about people I think about movies I love to Watch horror movies
OK
But there are times when the when, when I get scared I'm an adult.
You, you scare yourself,
I get scared and I go find out horror movies.
okay okay But your responsibility is to watch it, and you yourself scare yourself.
yes
OK well I don't like them and I don't watch them, I don't watch any of that type. That's why it's also my decision be- even though I'm old enough to watch it, if it's too violent, I don't want to watch it.
yes That's why That's why I respect what my son told me that time, Fifty percent is responsibility,
Yes
of, of the individual, of the person, eh, you already did the best you could, but then comes the time for the young people of the past to be eighteen at the.
that some are much more mature than normal
yes
And they starts seeing R-rated movies
mmm
at around fourteen and fifteen years old and the PG-thirteen the kids that are eleven and twelve years old are already seeing them.
Yes there
and even sometimes even the little ones. And even sometimes the much younger ones because I remember of Jenny's little friend who used to watch Harry Potter and it's
already thirteen already
-PG thirteen, PG fourteen and then I say, that Jenny doesn't like it because she gets scared.
Yeah
She gets scared with the monsters and all that.
Yes
But I am in accordance, that the major part is, the criteria that you form and that way in the end. take care of them and not let them watch television when they are by themselves.
Yes because, because
don't leave them alone with the t.v.
But imagine the same we can't control them.
But it's the television more then
That's why I'm tell you, you can control them, you can't see this movie because of this and this reason. because you need to be more mature or whatever you want to tell them, it's not true.
You have to have a formulated criteria to go and see some movies.
yes and that's why I'm telling you that you don't get nothing out in telling them, you can't see that, no. Because there will come a time in which they go to the house like I say to a friends house.
Aha, in the same school they show them movies
Or the same school, but the same school is under a little more supervision because that's another thing. Because, becacuase ther is a goal.
They show them documentals
But what I fear the most is when it goes to friend's houses. And the have the television right there, that's used a lot, or the computer, or whatever
And they have access to the information without the parents, no, without tha parents having any idea at all. And they are in the "piece" and the parents think they are listening to music or whatever
Maybe they are watching something non-adequate. That's why I say, I mean, if my son or daughter or whoever
is presented to that situation it needs to learn to value itself. And learn to answer to that. That's what I say, therefore trying, trying to give the values of the house
Keep going like the superman kid that went up to the window and kill himself
my, of course, because you know they are not ready for that
It wanted to fly. No, I don't want to aks you a question
aha
eh, did you read the rules for this game, the telephone game
yes, OK
Um, I was wondering, ah, who is this?are you ready for Christmas already?
yes, yes, yes I'm getting ready, buying the presnets for the family. But now I have, I have another things in my mind
of course about your birthday no
yes but, I'm getting ready, buying presents for all the famliy, at least for the nieces. I have them ready, we've bought you the presents, then there is only the adults left
Buy things for the adults, an antencion, although I'll make most of the presents
That's what I was going to tell you
I'm going to cook, yes, ah
cooking and sewing. Sewing that thing that you did, you gave that to me.
yes also for some children too.
Not that thing in the table.
yes, the, the, yes also, but I donÂ´t have time yet to wait until middle of, until the middle week of December to do it.
Oh, because they are
Because I donÂ´t have time before.
That is beautiful.
yes, so that is what IÂ´m going to do. ThatÂ´s why IÂ´m going to do some gifts, but for example, um, Andreita that is her about to be her birthday soon.
Two days before Miranda.
ItÂ´s AndreitaÂ´s birthday, too. Or, three
yes itÂ´s the twenty five or twenty four, I donÂ´t remember.
Oh, now I remember it was about three days.
Three days then from the twenty four. So, I have a little gift for her, I bought her the same as Miranda. So, uh
And what did you buy to Miranda?
For him I will- a screen like those that you draw and then you erase.
Oh itÂ´s nice
Because she likes, she already knew them and she likes them, she makes little dashes and then she erases them and, IÂ´m not going to give them to her yet because they are very small and she puts them in the mouth.
But the screen and the pencil yes, I will.
Oh thatÂ´s nice
But yes because little things like this.
what a feeling.
Sure, see, the. You really enjoy to do that kind of things, then I bought the same to AndreÃ­ta. And with that already,
And do you know who else's birthday.
Okay who
The same date
Who?
Until I remember when I was there
My father-in-law, that
Your father-in-law, yes
it is true who?
the, the, Juan Luis Sandra's younger son.
Oh yes Okay
Also the twenty nine. I also remember, that more or less in the same date, I remember that everybody were there in the same date
I don't remember that he was in at least I did not know.
No, you went to the Carlistos' birthday. and to, to the girl's
I have not gone to any birthday in Sandra's house. I was to one pure, I don't remember, really.
not you went once you went to Chile and left to her a present, that was for her birthday,
Eh, was in April, so, I went to Chile in April
Okay, That was other birthday, she is three.
And i left the gift in...yes, i left the gift in that place
yes, for her nephew who came later
Of course he came, yes, he told me that he received it afterwards from her. But his name no,
No but Sandra won't throw a party this year for her birthday
no no, okay
No, she said that family only, because they will buy something better for the kid, so
yes, it's true
She makes really big parties, so
it gets away from her hands, yes
She spends too much in that, and that's why they cannot buy the kid whats he,
What he really wants, yes exactly
they have to decide between the two things, so this year they decided that only the family
So he could get a more special present
Of course, for a better gift
Juan Luis is the big one or the small one?
The smaller of all
Oh yeah.
And he always says that he doesn;t want any clothes
Oh poor boy!
He doesn't want books, only toys
Carolina
Tamara.
Tamara how are you uh?
yes and you?
Well,well where are you uh ?
I am in the State of Washington,Seattle
wow, I am in Los Angeles.
Ah yes,
yes it is just incredible
yes
Right now I was making a call and suddenly and I did not think today is Sunday I was half sleep more then awake and I Oh my God!
yes,yes they get me off guard,but do you have time participating here?
Yes this is I believe my twenty third call.
wow it is almost ready, me well just half almost to the tenth.
yes and this is the second time I do this service with them.
Oh Okay okay yes because casualy I received  mail from them that they are accepting persons that can participate again, in the beganing it was only one time you could participate.
yes
no,did you get same mail Right? aparently this is going to continue, from what you can understand on the mailing they sent.
yes I are
rather yeah tell me
Then, what do you think about what they show in the movies, the?
Tell me? Well I am going to tell you honestly, I have more than a year since we stopped seeing movies movies in the regular movies and we switched to the cinema
not too "conventional"
aha
We switch to movies, for example in the case of the movies, no? just like on television.  Now we see movies kind of documentaries.  This... eh, with another kind of message then.
aha
You watch movies that are in in eh, What do you call that? Festivals, here there is one for example recently ended the Latin American International Film Festival
eh it was
yeah
Hello!
No, I am not here on my computer, I am sorry
Ah, OK This approximately a month or less than a month because since a long time ago as I tell you we decided we were not going to continue wasting time
time, in the majority of the cases really they are movies with a rather stupid and absurd content and well and we made the decision well that we didn't, we didn't want to wast either time or money
OK
Eh watching a type of movies that really don't give you anything.
Yes because there are lots of movies so, I have noticed
yes
yes I like a, around here where I live there uste to be one of those ah like Hollywood Video or Blockbuster but it was like
smaller
OK
and they had movies like the ones they're talking about, documentaries and stuff, but they had to close because since the big stores are around, people won't go to these places
Sure
but those are the best ones, I can find movies I like, yes, my husband is from America, but he likes international movies too, movies that have more
more important things to say
Exactly, exactly
From time to time, since I have young children, sometimes they want to see some movies and we take them, but usually no, we have. Before, we used to go to the movies two or three times a month
yeah
but now we reduced it, so it's once or twice every two months
Okay. Same here, we used to go more or less once a month, we went to the movies very often, very, and some day we watched a movie so
stupid, so dumb that I felt angry at being at the theater. I was thinking, what are we doing here? what waste of time is this?
No, no, no. And then we started getting information about other kind of movies, and well, we changed completely to that kind of movie. Actually ,right now we are in
in one of those phases, we are kind of intellectuals now, because we arrived at that point where you feel like
What are you doing? I mean, to watch this, I honestly prefer to go to sleep, or do something else instead of, not all movies, there are some that have
a different content, that's worth watching, but lately I feel they're making movies just for the sake of making them
yeah, exactly
it's like, well, he have to make 10 movies. We'll make then movies, it doesn't matter how, or when, just
making them up as they go along. Where are you from?
I'm from panama
Ah, okay, I'm from Venezuela
Oh, Okay
Yeah yes
then if it real is real
We say that to the "spot" no that good, yes make the movies how you want but if some come out good and others if they are not they are not
honestly no And the same is happening right now with the television we had cable and recently in a matter of a month we cut it off because no,no don't know all of sudden like
that we got against that we see that there was a lot of manipulation in the media they only give you the news they want and hide what they want
eh then that is a level of news and the movies then yea how no it is not a good money not  really very good
but they were repeating and repeating, and repeating Oh my God what is this we are paying for this then is kind a like annoying right now we have kind of annoyed.
with the means of communication we are like this,yes yes.
yes right what you say. I am here, my husband and I we watch news.
I believe aja.
because every time you see something or they put on something really stupid
exactly
Or the do or they exagerate a lot
Exactly.
Because when I was , we would be in Panama before Noriega got out of Panama
Just imagine
and we were overthere and My husband you know ? that white man white bought paper with my dad is dark and my mom is white and i came out dark like my dad like what
when we went out did you know he was American.
Logic,Logic
we would go in both. we would go in for whatever we had to go, he to go to the military base and I had to go with him  or something like that.
of course
and suddenly, we got home and we turned the TV on, and there were a bunch of stuff going on at Pananama, and i looked at him
Â¿Hey, weren't you and i over there this morning?, i don't remember watching any of that over there.
Exactly.
and the next day it was the same, and i say: Â¡oh what an ex-agent!, I think they where showing the things that happened last week and exaggerating like that, Â¿what
Exactl-
Since then, it got like, he doesn't want to believe what the TV says
Exactly.
the news, none of that; that's what i tell my kids, don't believe everything the TV says.
Exactly
Because it's not true, and this
Look, incidentally i borrowed a movie that's called the "the... some like "Panama's deception" or "PanamaÂ´s Defense"
Right
That's just when Noriega's problem and everything else we were watching the whole documentary, and i was like, it's cold, because i would never had imagined that it was so sad and so
so ugly what happened
That was the documentary where they spoke about that men that got his head cut off
and, oh yeah
It isn't, it isn't remembered
You know, i can't remember exactly, i don't remember but... what i can remember is that night, when they bombed and a lot of people died, uh, even so, a few days ago they showed a
a recall now during our President's visit
Aha
he was there and the people was protesting that Why? the current President did nothing to remember the victims of that sector
I think they were named "Los de Richos", "de Chinos" the sector where practically all the town disappeared and I
Oh "del churillo"
eh, "Del Chorrillo", exactly
yes, where there was. There, where the police station was, the part of the police station
aha, but in that place you say, almost happens the same in Venezuela with the current President. There are happening things that you know are happening to us.
that happened long time ago; then those things are put here in Venezuela and happens. Idiot, the other day I wrote to a reporter from
Univision. That donÂ´t be so shameless, that donÂ´t put those things there, that was not the reality, the first thing people tell you: eh! And that President
and whatever, he is a nuts, what happens is that the information is being twisted and he is shown like a monster, a dic-
tator, well a dictator, and we have been through four elections and four Referendum, it is not possible more democracy. But it is his personality, he has a personality that
is uncommon and then people donÂ´t accept that. And he is not a common person and people donÂ´t accept that, then he is the first critical of all that stuff
yes that
and and ah well, I donÂ´t know if you have heard him
no, no because as I tell you, I donÂ´t get to much in that news stuff, sometimes
of course, of course, look there is a page on the internet where you can watch television from all the countries including Panama, of course it is called
TV four all, like TV four all
TV
four all
Yes, Theater
Four is a number four
aha
- TV number four all
TV or Tv for all
exactly, exactly there you go
with
it is dot com yes
OK
there you see the programming of all the channels all the chanels of the world and then of ocurse Panama and Venezuela.  And then now I, now I see the Venezuelan television.
But specifically I watch the chanel from the government there.  Because the other channels are from the opposition, then of course it is a little bit more of the same.
but I like to watch to see what horrific things they are saying.
OK
So I compare and since I have this Internet page now I don't turn on the television. Now we are stuck with Internet watching channels from
the whole world, a bit like for comparing, what is going on and even we are doing it with radio, we're listening to community radio, that you feel like you ar-
are saying truly the truth or at least the other side of the coin, let's not say it's the truth a hundred per cent because sometimes it's not
I mean, it's like I don't know, it's not that you can say that that everything the others say is not but
aha
Good heavens! truly they manipulate it too much.
yes
I don't know if you
say?
you gave yourself a, I don't know if you watched a movie called Auto fox
No, maybe, but I don't remember.
It's a documentary about those who work in Fox News
mhm
and well the practically force them to say what it's not and then they decided to resign from the channel and besides resigning they all got together and the started to protest at a level
well, at the level of, of, eh, locally to tell the world what was going on inside Fox News. It's very interesting, it's called something like
"The Fox Workers that are Out"
some
Something like out of outside
aha
and Fox from Fox News
My name is
Hi, my name is Fernanda
Hi Fernanda, how are you?, my name is Claudia
how are you?
Where are yo talking...fine, Where are yo talking from?
from Washington
oh, which one?
Washington DC
oh, because there are two of them right?
yes, Washington State
Oh, and the other one
and you, where are you from?
I'm talking from Idaho, i don't know if you know it
Yes, of course
Yes, well, personally I don't believe that much about the movies ratings. For my point of view, the ratings don't go the way i suppose they would be
they don't know how to rate them. For example, sometimes they said that it is a PG movie, but when you watch it, and it really
has rude things, and pornography, and sometimes something stronger like a PG-13 is more quiet
and doesn't have that many nude scenes or bad language. Personally, I don't care about those ratings, sometimes it just
don't know. People who rate those movies, don't know how to rate them, or I don't know what are their point of view
Yes, i really don't know that much about movies, because
Aha
let's say, I don't have children or anything like that, so I barely ever notice
Aha
what, what classification
Aha
But I think that the majority of TV there is, let's say if you watch during the middle of the day that is when many times children are at home
Aha
are things that are not appropriate for most
yes
And I think that uhm Americans have, no - like the mo- moral standards have gone down, you understand? so
yes
many things already are like normal that that I think that they should not be
yes, yes it is true because, uhm, and it is true because uhm, oe time, well I don't have cable have, the regular channels, the ones one can watch
Aha
but for example, I got to have one, cable one time and sometimes it was, well, which ones do you like? ten am, eleven, and well I I like to be changing the channel
to be well choosing the program I am going to see for that whi- for that time
Hmjm
and sometimes they air movies that, boy, yes a ten or nine year old boy was at home and was watching the, was changing it too at the same time that I and
stop on that channel, there were things like very, like very for adults already
Sure
Then I said, uf, I said I thought about the children, I said, well, I, I am married, I have been married three years and I have a, a boy who is almost two years old.
OK
In any case my son is going to grow up and maybe this is going to get worse.  Then
of course and-
imagine then what kind of cartoons they are going to- well I remember that once I was watching television.  Look, in Mexico, I am from Mexico City
Mmh
It was ten at night exactly, ten at night.  Then, I turned on eh, I had cable there and I learned the, the cable to
to the channel that here is sixteen, then there was a cartoon in English.  Because at night they show some in English, some in Spanish
and there were cartoons in English. Then I told him.  And, my mom was well well quiet because he was watching a cartoon channel.
Well, well the cartoons started to show up naked
ah
and the cartoon was starting to do things the two cartoon figures.  And it was a cartoon, imagine, and it was ten at night, my mom told me
what a horror
she turned the television off and well she had to explain a bit because well my mom she, it didn't, it surprised her because I had tuned to a cartoon channel a normal channel.
Then, OK the truth, not even cartoons are safe.
yes and that could happen let's say to any child who was watching television.
Sometimes cartoons yes
And you cannot either be on top of let's say if the kid changes you cannot jump to see or whatever, you have to trust that, that let's say, at least during the day
yes
programming does not contain nudity or curse words or anything like that.
Yes, yes, it's true. But really it's not the cartoons, I'm sorry, the Japanese cartoons are are the ones that huh have more classification. In MÃ©xico, uh
uh, tru-, in CablevisiÃ³n and MultivisiÃ³n, that would be what cable here to- uh, there in MÃ©xico, it hasn't all those restrictions. But, for example, in normal tv's, with normal channels
Yes, it has like more, more restrictions. Uh, not so much now on the other cables. and, for example, In, in tv's, for example, normal of ch- children's channel
of television like, any channel, the, channel, for example, what is the five in cartoons
yes
for example, well, then at ten of clock, eleven, and you can watch TV and they don't put on programs so ugly like that. Well
in Mexico District, mhm
before, in MÃ©xico. But for example, if you're watching a cable channel now you risk the cartoon possibly being something sometimes some kind of
pornography thing or with more nudity.
i p- yes, i p-, look, I'm Colombian and i think that in Colombia neithe-
So, uh, right
the TV is a lot better than here in that way.
Right
because, they mig- might show, let's say at ten p.m. and the shows they put on are never so, you don't, you're not at risk, Â¿right?, for them to be as bad as here. Here
Right
even so, here not even at ten, neither at ten or at any other hour are you risking to watch anything else
Yes, that's true fi- the other, well, uh, i was with a neighbor, and imagine, i was with a neighbor, it was twelve, twelve and a half p.m.
And then her kid was watching, uh, the a cartoon channel and after that the girl wanted to change the channel and, uh, it was another channel that was also programmed for them, for kids.
Well there has a program were it was, were there was a, a girl that showed the adventures of a girl and that was, in a hospital
and suddenly, it went right there in the hospital, and they were showing how, how her mom was having her little brother.
ah, yes?
Aha, but it showed and I went and told her, her mom of hers and she told me ah, there's no problem, it's a channel of
of, of cartoons, of, that they show a lot of programs. And, honestly it was it was, it didn't, it didn't leave much to the imagination. I was really like the pose of, well it was like an operation room where the woman was having her baby.
what horror
They were, they are six years old.
yes
Because they're twins, she is, eh, they both are six years old. And their mom was letting them see that, well, each, each parent allows to see what
what they want. But honestly for m- if I don't want to explain too much to my children in that moment, well honestly I, like, keep watch more what,
well, what they see. no? in that aspect. But, uff.
yes, imagine when, let's say there are there are babysitters and things like that that you don't have control and you're not in the house to see
mm aha
you don't know what they're watching, that they go to their friends or whatever.
yes no
I think
yes, it's one of those, really those classifications that they have. And n- and n-, mainly for television. They truth, now, now n-
they don't leave anything to the mi- to the imagination, they show it right away.
yes
Now at any time of the day and you go and watch soap operas. I don't like watching soap operas. But, you see
many mo- moms are at home and they have little children three, four years old, five or more or they're at home and they watch, they're watching their soap opera
and they're al- always show scenes where they are the, the couple, they're there having relations.
hmm
And in the middle of the day, because the soap operas later are on from six in the morning until nightfall.
Of course
And that's how they are. So now they don't leave anything to the imagination.
no, I
So, the programs, are classified, to see a scene of pornography on the television at anytime of the day is normal. And for many
parents unfortunately are making it normal
exactly
And I believe that that if the parents spoke to this television station and said that or demand that that were more strict programs to, to privacies of scenes, of this type of scenes
I believe that they would decrease a little. But anyways, not now or , until parents if their children see something like that, it's okay, it's no problem.
it doesn't matter to them, hmm
teaching. And so, these things of classifications I don't like. And I believe it doesn't matter to the producers. Be-I feel that to them its beneficial because
if a movie has some sex scene or has crudeness for the people they buy it or the people see it and they even s-they laugh,
or sometimes it even calls their attention because it has a very strong scene. So really, these these things sometimes even help more
producers to sell
sometimes, and
If that's the case, no. Uh, for me in particular, the type of movies that I like, in truth I really like Disney movies, the
children's movies. I like them.
yes, yes , yes
Even though I, I am tired and I love all of this. I have some Disney movie around here. Sincerely, I do not like the movies
strong so that, that have many things of, of sex and all that because equally, I repeat to you that I am going to have more kids and while I am not going to be and
and at least that if they are going to put on a movie, well that it is at least a decent movie.  That it does not have so many things.
of course, of course
That is so that while we have those from Disney, at least they are going to be have pornography, right?  Then/Well,
yes he/she does not know how they are going to change
no, no, yes then already, this is the truth, this is bringing the truth far as it already goes, you turn on the television and if you.. you already see a commercial.
of feminine towels and it seems fine/well until almost, almost.. they are goint to explain to you how, while they are going to put a naked woman and they are going to..you
put there how she is placing the towel
exactly
Because sometimes until they show it to you.  I don't know if you have seen the commercials that ugh.  Likewise/Equally it frightens you because you are big, right? but..
but if a boy or a girl is seeing it for example, and yoiu say if it is the mom and you can answer, well fine, and if it is the friend (boy or girl)
and you tell them, and can explain to him/her the bad information, then...
and that one becomes acostomed to it, do you understand me?  We say
then already - yes
so that sometimes I see and like that one does not realize how they have changed things
Good Evening my name is Mariza from Philadelphia.
Hello Hello mi name is Juan you are Marisol
Mariza, Mariza.
I see Mariza, we talked a few days ago I think, no.
Oh, chin, maybe yes,
I could be, I am in San Antonio, Texas
In San Antonio, yes.
Listen the theme for today is about religion, no.
yes, that is a complicated and very controversial theme
well exactly, like the need of religion is something that we all have, I think
mhm
and this is like any other need, the institution tried of,
yes
give us answer.  And ends been like a way to control, no.
Ah, yes really today in this country.  Eh, In the United States there is a lot, lot of problems regarding religion, it is a mix with politics and lot of right side people that want to have control.
tried to control the country in base of religion also and, it can be positive or it can be negative to many people, it help to pray or believe, help in others, in others, of others
in other way, the, the, the Christians is the most powerful religion in the world and there a more, let's say that have power to have influence in politicians, to the countries
yes, let's see in this case, for example here where I live, I went to a church
mhm
that, they express a project of, ideology, but regarding a conservative group in the United States, no.
Hmm, yeah
Then they exerted a power very, very direct, very, sure, trying to influence people there at the church
Yeah
With the discourse, it came to my attention against the public schools
Aham
Directly against the public schools and praying for God to free us from public school some day
Really?
Because yes
Oh, oh, no
And against the theory, about trying to see the theory of evolution, no
Oh, I've heard that, yes
No, terrible, they said, Why is this excruciating the teachers that teach the Bible to explain the creation of the world?
Exactly, yeah, there are a lot of problems, yeah
Well, I'm getting carried, what I say is that, reasonably, the Bible doesn't make for a explanation of the world
No, everyone can believe what they want what it is is that they try to impose their beliefs to everyone and for the Bible, for what they think
Exactly, they're fundamentalisms, no
Yeah, fundamentalism, yes, yes, yes, from the right wing, But also the country is, ah, the party has the power so, everyone from the president to everyone who is into this, at the White House, they're all rightwing republicans.
Target of, uh, Christians and they are the ones that The people with power in the country, the ones with the companies, everyone is, maybe, there are a lot of rightwing republican fundamentalists who want to take the law away.
The right to abort, the right of, for example another question was, homosexuality, gay marriage, the right to the belief of
yes, more scientific, no, no, you can't just believe what they say, they say God created man and woman, you also have to give a choice for kids to believe,
that was Charles Darwin who came up with the theory of evolution. And
yes
And it's really complicated too, about, the other question was about homosexuality, yes, yea. If we were all equal or we all believed the same thing, there wouldn't be any problems, I was asking.
But
Well I think that maybe, as similar as we are, more problems, no.
yes
In that sense, the differences help to complement each other.
Right, for me, I don't have any,
The subject, the subject of homosexuality is very controversial,
mhm
But at any given time, it's not a, like let's go, like tolerance of the phenomenon of homosexuality has to be something like, that, that we're well informed about, no, I for example used to think that,
it could have something to do with a deviation, homosexuality, but lately I've read that it's a matter of, of genetics.
Yes I, I'm convinced it's that because I know a lot of people that are,
No
uh, well homosexuals, or lesbians and, I'm really informed and so that's why yea I never know because. Ever since I was, since I was a girl, well,
Like I would accept people for, I never thought they were better or worse for being homosexual and that everyone has the right to to, well I don't know, well to get married, to,
Well yes,
to be with whoever they want. It's the same if it's a man or a woman, to me it matters, it doesn't matter to me and I think that we all have the same rights because we're all citizens, and they pay the same taxes.
yes
They have to have the right to get married, to live with whoever.
yes yes I agree with you, exactly I think that, they have all the rights, because we can have any other type of person and in this cases the marriage rights are relatives
well many drive the homosexuality question as a very wicked situation and they don't have rights to marriage, no really when marriage is really a contract
mhm
between two persons that stated doing something in comun.
right, but the church won't see it that way.
No,
believe that it is an abomination because marriage is define as the union between a woman & a man and believe, and the, people & christian fundamentalist like I said before they see it as an abomination, and they are so closed mind that they don't understand that
that was before, the tradicional thinking but now times have change and each one also.  Same as before, homosexuality has been always, since the beginning of man but before was a way and now is ,
I don't know thinks are more liberal, let's say people isn't scare to talk, like I am homosexual, or I am gay or I am whatever
that is the problem.  The Church has a problem, but they cannot do anything.
aha
People is accepting the echo from people, yes like he is homosexual, yes and well
right, yes like there is one that is so exreme, eh, the family and marrige, the eclesiastic institution and the blessing of God for marriage and things when in reality
well the church and religion is a way of institution, like school, have
right.
the need to change and find new ways to learn thing of life.
yes
from society and individuals, no.
yes, the religion has to be something personal, no something that mix with politics, each one can, the, think, what you believe is each one, doesn't have to be what,
eh, let's see why you don't think the same as me, you are no me, well, like you get punish because we are diffent, and shouldn't be that, each person can think whatever they want, believe in anything or anyone, don't have,
for the christians, because they talk badly about the Muslims because they say they are radicals or they talk badly about, the atheist because they don't believein god and they call them  heretic or ,
But I don't know
right
That is very christian, you have to accept the people like they are, and each and everyone one of them that believes or has your religion, but that is the problem with the fundamentalists, that they don't accept the differences.
yes, well, but in that case, accepting the difference seems like something that has to do with the matter of humanity right
mm
Like one paradox not be able to accept the difference they think but, right
What happens is that yes, because in this country the kids when, the families, the christian families, that, righties, say that they raise their children in a manner that, when they are very little they teach them to be like that, and that's how it is, so
When they are older and know that people are different, well they say, no that is not right, because they taught me like that, and that is how they have to be.
you know they are very, radicals, no, they don't accept differences because they were raised in a manner that their parents taught them, so
yes
and for example, I had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of different races, cultures, so I am very open to everything.
right
And so when I see a person who is not, and so I immediately know, only by looking at them I say, this person, will not accept me because I'm not like them, I am not, I don't think the same, I don't look the same.
But is that there are classes there are mu- people of different classes, and well, there has to be radicals Christians there has to be everything, but I think that yes, religion does influence the country, yes.
Eh, yes influences a lot, what fascinates me is that in this case,
yes
In this country, being so fundamentalist, right
Yes I am
With the churches, there is a great proportion of fundamentalist even in the discourse of the president himself there are fundamentalists
Of course, yes, yes, yes
Not there,
The message is very clear and it's already been five years in government, and when Bill Clinton was in government, he was not so, he was more open let's say, of course he was a leftist, more ope- a person more
that understood more people's concerns and, this government let's say that they don't have the. Well that, the, the religious Christians of the right that is the ones that are
saying how to do things in the country and that's why there is such a polemic with marriages also there is with the, with the supreme court with, with, the judges that they want them to be from the right also and that they are religious well, they
to be or Catholic or that they are also they want that, that they take away the right to abortion and things like that, that is, is ridiculous at this stage of the century.
aha
That like, that they want that things go backwards, that they go back instead of going forward they want that things become as they were thirty or forty years ago and that cannot be.
But, that's how we are now.
aha, and do you practice any religion in particular?
I in my family are from, in Spain I'm Cat- Catholicism let's say it's as soon as you're born they baptize you, first communion and all that, so I got married in the Church
Sure.
I believe, well, I have my beliefs, but I don't go to church, to mass every Sunday, neither do I practice, you know, I don't practice, I am, I believe
but let's say that I carry it on my own, let's say that I carry faith with me, I don't
yes
neither, neither am I, I mean I am very open I mean it's like contradictory that I am a believer, I am Catholic, but no you know, I am not funda- nothing
yes The same with me and when sometimes I get closer with the Catholic church, it is almost temporary because they are they say listen where there is a feeling of integration, of community there is
created interests in everyone it seems
yes, yes, yes there is much economic interest, yes
no, then
That is the problem, it is that it goes right away that they are not interested on the followers, they are interested on money, and
yes
And also they don't look like such believers either, there have been many cases of, of child abuse and things like that, of child abuse
Which you hear, and you question, and how can this be possible. That a a priest do that to a child.  There is much polemic regarding that.
yes
But, Let's say faith, it is each one, I don't know that each person is free to believe what he wants, and practice it, but respecting others who are not the same.
aha
Because there are many religions and what happens is that the Christian religion is the most let's say abundant in the world, it is the more, the one that has the power on everything
Because in the world we have, on this side of the world no, because I believe that I only believe that not even the majority of Christians, I believe there are more Muslims than Christians.
Yes but they don't have as much economic power, that is the problem.
Mmh.
Hi, good night.
yes, good night.
Good night. My name is Carolina.
Ah, how are you Carolina? talk to Alex
How about Alex?
of Los Angeles.
Ah, very good, I'm from New York.
Oh, okay, I thought you were the other person. Okay?
Aha.
I am here in Los Angeles
ah, well and good, nice.
Gladly.
Well we played tonight, the technical equipment.
Where are you from?
I'm from Peru.
Oh, okay.
And you?
Eh, I am from the Columbian residence.
Columbian?
Mhm.
Oh, but he speaks like a mexican.
Because here people speak Mexican Spanish
Yes
Right.
Oh, okay, sure.
you stick to the, you stick to the accent from where you live.
Oh.
With the, when I lived in Spain it got stuck the-, the Spanish accent
Mhm.
when I lived in Colombia, it got stuck the Spanish from Colombia. from BogotÃ¡, in particular.
Mm. Mhm.
Now it is the turn of the Mexican Spanish
Oh, that's good.
That it is what it is spoken here
Yeah. yes.
Oh, I believe that the Hispanic here are more or less ninety five percent mexicans.
Yes, right, yeah.
yes.
yes, so the tonight topic is the technical equipment.
yes, oh I use, I use computers
Already.
and ah, I have rapid DSL now.
Mhm.
yes, because I like fast internet, I don't like to waitfor pages
Already,
thenfor me it is very useful because I search for work, I do polls I look for women
Mhm.
mmu- , many things and, and I don't like to wait for the, the pages, ?do you understand me?
Mhm. Already,
I like to do it fast and, and before that, when it had the line, by telephone
yes.
it was very slow.
Very slow, yes
Then I had to wait some two or three minutes only for one, one page to appear
Already, clear.
and until now, you can carry a webcam, and, and the webcam comes fast with the DSL
Already, safe.
The webcam is when can see you ah, like tele-, co-, video conferences conference
Mm Mhm.
It is fast.
Mm, yeah, sure.
And you?
Well, for me, also, of course and I work, my jo-, I am an administrator and then eh, my job I use and for me the computer, that is
the most essential, and above all eh, and new techniques, no? new technologies that have come and every day more new things come up, no?
yes.
So, the truth is that I have adapted very well and I love it since I've been using the computer, because well before I used a type writer that was so slow to
write documents and forms, and everything, now everything is done through the computer and the Internet, no? I mean it's something amazing
for me, it's essential, I think that I wouldn't know what to do without computers, no? So, the truth is that I'm very happy with this new technology, and I hope it keeps going
forward more every day, no?
Mm, of course, I believe that, they have, e-, they have made more a- advancements in the computer that they have mane in, with medicine.
That's true.
The computer is the most advanced of civilization now.
Aha, yes, and for everything, no? I mean it's all one
yes.
want you find it there and well when one sits down in front of well, i use it for my work, but well also when I'm at home and I need
some information, well I sit down in front of the computer and there's no stopping me, I don't know, when it's like with something, an essential part of one's life, no?
yes, exactly.
For everything, because if you need to know what the temperature is outside, well you go to the computer.
News, sports.
Before it was yes, mhm.
Oh, going out with women, of everything.
yes,yes,yes.
No, and even that survey that we are making now, I found it by the computer also.
Oh, also, yes, oh
Yes, almost mm, then the computer has a lot of influence.
Ok,right, and how many calls you made?
In our lifes, twenty-two,this is my hm, twenty-second call.
Oh, and hm,you are finished then.
I almost need about three, but one call that the person spoke more in english,I think is going to have a replacement.
Oh, now, now.
bu- but, who knows?
Now,mhm
Because I spoke in spanish, then they should consider.
mhm, now.
Because if you speak in english,they do not count it.
But they give you the payment after you finish the twenty-five calls. no?
Yes,you do one call to replace.
Yes,o,now,now, mhh.
I went to speak to him, I know the owner of this.
Oh, yes?
and, and I am going to ask if it will be on me to replace it.
Oh, ehm, do you know the owner?
yes.
Oh, that is great
yes, it is easy, it is easy to speak with him.
Oh, is he from is he from there from California?
No, he must be in Philadelphia
Oh, I see, I see, I see
but, but he gave me his ph-
Oh, but do you know him personally?
No, no, no, no.
Oh, just through the computer
yes, I know him through the computer, but he
through the internet, I see, aha
but he, he talks with people that are participating
Oh, I see, ehm, yes?  Oh, no I never have speak with him, I
yes, then if you have any questions you can him, he is Chinese
Oh, yes?
yes, wel-, I don't know if he is the owner, he is
Oh.
him, the manager
yes
yes, that, for supervisor, of the project they are doing
Ok, ok, OK
yes, they are studying the way we talk Spanish
Ok, right and
Don't know, you heard that
yeas, yes i did, and i think that they will start another one after they finish this one.
No, i don't know, most probably they do, because i, i already did two.
Mhm
On in English and another in Spanish
Oh, so this is the second, oh, yes ?
yes, and what we're doing right now is technology
Oh, oh.
because they are doing phone line connections
Yeah right, ah, and the other was almost equal, twenty five calls ?
and this is technology yes, something like that, was the same thing,  but in English
Right, and they payed you too, equal ?
Yeah they paid the same
Oh, ok, OK
Yes, I like to do this not only for the payment, but for the opportunity given to me.
Ah, good.
to speak in Spanish
Of course.
because it is the t-, the only time in, the day that I speak Spanish.
Mm, yes.
I, I speak very little Spanish now, most of my day is English
Oh, yeah, right.
Yes.
Yes.
And what
Goo- Yes, of course it is.
This could not be done for about twenty, thirty years, what we are doing now
Exactly, yes.
because they are using multiple telephone lines to connect many people living in different parts of the country.
Exactly
I think phone technology has made progress because I can also make long distance phone calls, and I do not have to pay.
ah, a monthly fee
Yeah.
and you can make all the calls you want.
Oh, but here in
And that wasn't, that wasn't like that in five or ten, twenty years.
Ofcourse, but here in the United States.
Here in the United States, yes
Oh ya, ofcourse, yes, yes, justifiably I have just received ah, from Verizon that they are offering me free calls here in the United States
yes.
and they give me and in the meantime they charge me.
if they charge you something monthly, but if you make a lot of calls, it's worthwhile.
yes. ofcourse.
and you know what? Some day they will make it international also for your favorite country.
Ah, how good it was.
You pay a monthly quote and you can make the calls you want.
Ya, yes.
yes.
How great it would be. No? it would be excellent for calling the country when one wants I think it will be like that but with the cards also. no? every day.
before it was pricey. Remember before? For calling the country of
And it is cheaper, right?
now it is very cheap, of course
And why is it cheap? Because of technology.
That, ofcourse, yes of course yes
yes, technology.
Now you can talk three four or five hours for five dollars.
Exactly.
Before it was one minute, oh my god it was like eight
One minute was twenty cents, yes
And yes, I remember that I had to talk, I think that just ten minutes was, it cost me like twenty-five dollars.
Mm.
and I had to be careful a lot have the clock in front of me, no?
yes, yes, yes that has happened to me too
yes, aha
that yes, yes, yes, ah, I know that yes, what it is, you have to be with the clock
Aha. Of course.  Ah, yes
yes, but eh, with, with
yes, I have, the truth is that, hopefully technology continues moving ahead, I say that here in about ten years, what are they going to come up with, no?
Because like this has to be moving forward, no?
What happens is that like it is advancing and technology is in the hands of, of more people
Mmh. Mmh
then services are cheaper, because they sell to more people
Na- Sure, yes
do you understand?
mhm, of course.
eh, for example, the computer, the computer a few years ago was worth one or two thousand dollars.
exactly yeah
now you can buy a computer for two hundred or three hundred dollars,
yeah that's true, ha
because there's more demand.
of course, of course, ha
because technology has adavanced.
of course, that's true.
what i would like to see is
yeah
more advanced technology, with medicine.
mm
they have to find cures for things like cancer, if you can go to the moon, why cant they find a cure for cancer? it could be, they could make a
true.
fast computer that can think, why cant they find a cure for cancer?
mm, mm
i want to see more advances in medicine, i think their going slow in that area.
mm yeah
i haven't really seen so many advances, in diseases in the past 10,20,30,40 years.
Mm. Mm.
Goo-
It's true, because of the cancer and how many years it has
yes, it kills many people, right?
and we did not find the cure, right? And he is, right?
Right? That shortens the lives of many people.
A- yes, yes, yes.
Or, or heart disease as well.
Mhm. AIDS, now that it is so widespread across many sites.
AIDS is more advanced than cancer, in, in
