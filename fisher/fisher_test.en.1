Hello
Hi
Hi, good evening, who is this?
how are you, eh I'm guillermo, how are you?
oh Guillermo
yeah
oh, its me jose
How are you, where are you from?
oh, pe- i live in Philadelphia
Philadelphia
yeah, yeah what about you?
Well, I'm peruvian, im currently studying in the university of pennsylvania.
oh, what are you studying?
I'm studying history.
oh I'm a student as well, im a senior
What university?
from, the university of Pennsylvania as well.
oh really
yeah yeah, I'm almost done now.
oh that's good.
But, but what
And you what's, what are you studying?
Well, I'm in Wharton
Hm
Then, business, yes, but, then you're studying a PhD, a Master's, what is it exactly?
It's, uh, no, undergraduate
Ah, it's undergraduate, ah, okay, okay
Hmm Hmm Hmm
Ah, but you're here now
Sorry?
you live in Peru, then?
I, sorry, what did you say?
Do you live in Peru?
Yes, I live in Peru until, until three months ago
Ah
Sure, uhmm
Then you're a freshman or
no, what happens is I studied two years in the university in Peru, and then I transferred here. I'm an international transfer
Ah, okay, then you're not exchange student, you're transfer
Sure, it's, I mean, I'm getting graduate with a diploma from this university
Oh, oh, that's good.
Instead of a, exchange student, for example, ¿right?
Oh, good. ¿And what do you think so far?
Uh, it's a little hard, actually.
Yeah, but that's because of the English or...
And, n-, well, the english, the English is in fact a, let's say
everything, all the work.
It's a difficulty, i mean, uh, uh, i have, i have studied English for a long time in my life, but still, it's harder to explain myself in english, than in Spanish
Yes, yes
Right, i mean, that's uh, that's very clear to me.
Yes.
Uh, but also, yes, by the amount of work that i get, that's also a
¿More than in Perú?
I, yes, i think so, they send you more
Uh um.
More, more than in Perú. Even last cycle, i, in Perú, er, in my University, i took six courses. Er, in a semester.
Uh um.
And, even so, i think i had less work than what I'm having now, taking five courses.
Uh um.
But well, the thing is that I'm taking five courses, but also working.
Ah, okay okay
I don't know, suddenly that's the equivalent of taking six courses, something like that.
yes yes
Perhaps is, a little less, I don't think that is as, as demanding like taking six course, but
yes, but I mean it still is pretty intensive
I think so, yes, I don't know perhaps in the future I decide
yes is hard.
I, I, I'll decide to take less courses, I don't know. How many courses do you take more or less per cycle?
Um Depends. And, in general, five but ah sometimes, is only like- but at the end, last cycle I only took four, but now I'm taking five
Okay, and , and you
And, but generally, in, in College people only take four.
Yes
I think so, yes, but in Wharton in general people take five.
I understand. And besides you work, or
Eh
or are you dedicated full time to, to your studies?
Yeah I have yes, I have a little job there in the library, is Work Study but is there, is not really a job  because when I'm there,
I study, so is not really like that
Ah, that seems very advantageous. What, you do, I also work in the, in the library but I'm a Shelver
Mm
So, I really have no time to study.
Ah, I used to do that sometimes but, which one are you on, which part of the library? In
In the fifth floor of Van Pelt
Mm, okay, okay
And you, where do you work?
In Lippincott
Where's that?
It's a library in Wharton
I see
yes, it's on the second floor mm, no, but, yes, it's there, it's a good job because I only work, I don't work for longer that five hours per week, sometimes I work ten hours per week but
still, I have time to do my  homework, so, it really is not that, sometimes, sometimes, towards the end we do have a little bit of more work because
more people need our help, and everybody
Hm mm
are doing research and in general, it's quite, I don't have a lot of work to do.
Hm mm
But here, I've seen that for example, sometimes jobs in Latin America, but did you see that in Europe,
in the universities, during the, well, in general, they don't really work that much until the end, then the professors,
ah, in England for example?
yes, yes, in Europe in general, true,
yes, I've heard that too, I mean, the amount of work, for example, the number of hours that they take per week,
Hm mm
they are i think less then three
Hm mm
then we have a lot of free time. or lets say does not have many classes.
yes yes yes
and apart I think yes. or they do not give you a lot of work. I am not sure no
yes well well,well they can no,they do not give much work but eh,in general they want that we supposed real that one is
that we read everything that we exercise and do that all that right.
sure Hm mm,hm mm
I understand all right and then at the end they give us an exam and that is your note. but here in United States is
different right. because here especially here in history they have investigation and then a practice , then something else and an exam and
Hm mm
is better in the scense that one,okay there are less risks ay
yes sure that,that,that,that this difinitely that is an advantage that there are less risk.
he traba-yes yes but
because really imagine that for example you go to,to,to to ,to decide your course note in your exam and all of a sudden the prevous night you could not sleep well o
anything can happen an all of a sudden
yes
in the exam you don't make it or i say you could have prepared a lot but for x reason you did not do well in the exam
yes
I mean, let's say the note
yes
it, it, the note goes down, no, I mean, I don't know.
yes yes yes, no, but also there are but all the work they give you, I mean yes every week you have one thing and another
another job, another job, then
yes, yes yes.
each one has its system it has its advantages.  But, in, and in Peru, how is it, in general?
Let's see, I mean, I would tell you also they make us work, I mean, we don't like the the equivalent to midterms
Hm mm
but that are primarily reading tests,
Hm mm
Eh, throughout, I mean, scattered, let's say, throughout the semester,
Hm mm
And for some classes, not all, they also ask you, at the end of the class, to, to hand in an essay.  A research project
Hm mm
And besides, you also have a final exam.  But, let's say you don't have to produce as much, as you produce here.
Hm mm
I mean, you don't have to write so much.
Hm Hm mm, hm mm
Here they have you constantly writing, papers and reviews isn't it like that
yes
not much beyond, or rather beyond what you had to write, for example, write for examination, or deliver, or in research
Hmm
at the end of the semester. But beyond that, no you did not have to produce much
yes yes
Well, I mean, that could be seen as an advantage the sense that you don't have, do not, no, do not ask for much, not true, or is
you can live a little more relaxed
yes yes
but at this point, the downside is that you do not get, you can not practice, you do not, you're not in a constant practice of the work
of research, nor how to describe, not true, or sometimes yo not to describe all that, you lose a little, not all, but to describe. then
Hmmm hmmm
i tell you that, like, is more like, easier, like
yes Hmmm, hmm
It's a lot easier, but i don't know that, tell you, if they prepare you like they do here
yes yes
but it costs, that your prep, like, the cos is that here they prepare you better, right, but at least, i, for example, this weekend, I'm full of stuff to dom then
you live a little more, like, at least, i live a little more  anxious, say that, a little more
yes
stressed
yes yes
But I don't know what it would be like in Wharton I don't know.
yes good, it's, it's different because in Wharton well it also depends, good. Depends, because, for example, I say, the classes that I took in general, they don't have
like essays, or research projects, just in general there's two, three tests, and, and, that's it. But there are classes for example that have more to do than just that, like well one has two exams, but you also have to do projects.
Ya
Those kinds of things like case studies.
And they are just personal tasks or group ones?
In, groups, usually, these days almost everything's in groups. And sure, if they give you work, things, things so that you are reviewing, because if they didn't
because, and, and, and, I liked it like that, for example, every week to have work, small stuff that you have to turn in, because, that way
you're forcing the person to study each and every week.
Sure
But, yes, that, that, that, I liked that, sometimes, they do that, but usually, there's exams, or projects. But in
Hm mm
every class they always have a test, I don't, I've never have had a class where it just consists of projects, really, but usually two tests, and maybe a project.
Hm mm, hm mm
In the, well, now we have a Marketing class we have, a, a, project that is like a , I don't how they did it, eh, eh, and
They made a whole software program that was like a simulation and then one, for example, every request well, there's like five orders, or six orders, then
everyone has a group
Hm mm
And so the whole world, to each group they assign a, a company
Hm mm
So, you have several products, this company has several products, so one has to decide based on, on each product, well, where we go, what kind of
ho- ho- how we're going to sell this product, we're going to
Ah, how interesting
sell more yes, yes, it's, it's like one, one is in a com- of course it's not like in real life, but
But, I mean, it's similar in a way
it helps, yes yes, it's not, it's, no, interesting, but, ba- then after- wards when that's over, you have to write several like that, essays, do an analysis
of what one did, of the, the mistakes, of what one did right,
Hm mm
So, there are many things like that too. So everything, everything depends on the class, but
Hm mm
eh, yes, here yes, there is an I, I barely write anything in general. So it seems a bit strange that I had to write.
Yeah.
But, em and what else, and now, and the and the weather here it du- I'm sure you don't like it, right
how come?
too- too cold here, right?
Well, yes yes yes yes. On Tuesday, I think it was, at night, I think it was raining
yes
I was frozen, yes, I mean, I have to carry my coat, I mean with my I have es- I, I bought a coat that's fairly warm
Nah, yes
And I have for, I mean, I always go out with it. But even so, even, sometimes, using my coat, I'm cold too, no. But well, inside my dorm it is much more, well,
Hm
driving the matter.not inside the dorm the temperature is that it is enough
Pe-
hot,no.
but in Peru,they told me there are regions where it is very cold right.
Well sure.yes if you go to the mountain that is
Hm mm
also at night also if you go in winter to the mountain on on  winter Eh the winter nights on the mountain are very cold yes.
Hm,I see.
I would say that.oh it i had gone to the mountains from Peru and thing on vacation with my family and yes at nights.
it could be colder that until now I have experienced here
Hello ?
Hello, my name is Gloria
Hello Gloria, I'm Paulina, where you calling from ?
Oh from New York
New York, I'm from Georgia
From Long Island
Ah ?
From Long Island
Long Island
Aha
I'm in Athens, Georgia
Oh, from, Georgia, oh my God
Mhm, and what is like ?
I didn't understand what she said
What ?
Something religious, She said that she talks
I don't get what she said
No
I was talking about religion, what is you opinion about it, if unites people, or separates them, if we all need to have the same religion or, what do i know ?
From, ah, okay, I'm catholic. I, i believe, am, it separates some and unites others. For example, i have a nephew that is gay.
so, them in the catholic religion, they don't accept gay people
Right
Because god didn't make them like that. But, i remember that when my, my nephew was born, at one year, we knew that him, what he, what he was going to be.
People don't believe that they're born like that, but he really was born like that. And only if you have someone like that in your family, you know. So he
he's got a lot of trouble with the catholic religion, because they don't accept him, and he knows they don't accept him. But he finally found a church, on the thirty two in New York, that accepts homosexuals.
Right. Well, i think that, as far as religion, that if people followed their religion, there wouldn't be so much trouble like when the ones that go to the extremes, in any religion.
Um, right.
If people followed, for example, the ones that followed Jesus Christ, if they followed Jesus Christ teachings, and id they acted like Jesus Christ
Um
There wouldn't be so many problems
Right
But when they start fighting, that's not what he taught
Um
Jesus Christ
Exactly
Where there's trouble
Um
The same with the Muslims
Um
Or the jewish, the principles of, of those religions and what they preach
Mhm.
yes, that's, they are good things. When people become fanatics and fail to accept other people, fail to respect the differences,
Aha. Aha.
I think that's when division, problems, arise.
yes, yes, yes. Like this, who've said? In my lunch time, the girls that I work with, where I work, three
I carry this, this little book by Joyce Myers, and he, everyday scriptures. So, I read it to them and they say, that's shit, and I'm like, but
hey, she's saying, treat your neighbors kindly, like you would like them to treat you. And she's like oh no, I don't have to treat them right.
I don't like her, I say, but everybody has been created as God's image, and so we started fighting. I said, look, I want peace, because that's what it matters and I don't, so that I don't
speak of that subject again. But, forget about it, it's been done and they still want to hang out with me. So that I read to them everyday
that's good.
Because, it was like a firecracker, I was telling her that I don't want to be near her because she takes my
energy away from me. And she's always criticizing everybody else and I don't want to, I don't want to be in that environment. And they she says, yes and I go and read to them everyday, and the other days, they say
write five things that you are grateful to God for, ehm, am, that you think that you, forget it. She's always like, ah, you are always reading religious stuff,
and I say, that's the only thing that has saved me because, otherwise, I would be gossiping, everybody speaks of me and I know that I'm a good person, God created me this way.
and if I let people hurt me, I would've jumped out of a window
yes.
So, that's what happens to her, they criticize her, so I tell her, hey, God loves you the way you are but you have, you can't be criticizing other people.
And that's true, the same thing happens when
yes.
between people, in religion, as a community, you, the, see what happens in Israel between the
Aha.
between Palestinian and the,
yes. Aha.
and the jews.
Aha.
It's sad, they fight all the time
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
because they are sacred places for the two of them, but they don't respect
Aha, aha.
other people.
It's like, the, eh, eh, it's like Catholicism, everybody is leaving it, like my, my friend left for another church. She tells me that,
this and that, and this and that, and I say, you have to find a church where you really want to be, that you believe in, that you are satisfied with it.
Or that, I won't tell you to go to a Catholic church, if it's not doing anything for you, because I go to a Catholic church.
So, then, she told me that she had found another church, and she told me "maybe you should go with me", and I said, no, leave me alone, I will stay where I am, I'm happy where I am
You know, I go to charismatic prayer groups, so, then, I don't like to attend other churches, I won't tell you why I don't go, but I don't want her to
I haven't go to that church for a long time. And, they spend their whole Sunday there, I don't have a whole Sunday to spend there
three, four hours.
Ah, yes
Aha.
What's religion is that? The one of your friend?
Oh, eh, I believe that Christian Science, something like that.
Oh.
yes, yes, yes. They are like born again Christians, something like that.
Okay.
Something like that, yes. So, then, you know, I was Catholic. But, my husband goes to the Catholic church. I, in my house, the only one that goes to church is me. My kid doesn't like to go, I'm always arguing with him to go
And, he doesn't believe that God is helping him, it's me, everyday I tell  him, you see, this God gave to you, like today we were talking about
of Katrina, and he says, oh, God did that, that,
Mm.
And I couldn't convince him that it wasn't God. that it was an act, you know, an act of God, how they say, but it wasn't
God himself, that he doesn't let that, even though the bible said things like that were going to happen, I was telling him, maybe you should read the bible, it teaches you what there is.
Mm, yes.
Mm.
That' how it is, I find that, as far as religion, many people just go because of tradition only, and
Aha, yes.
when you go and search for him, the truth,
Aha.
and really search, there you find a religion that,
Aha, aha. Yeah.
you like. But, many people that only go, only for tradition, but they don't even know what their own religion is about.
Exactly, they sit there, and when the priest finishes, they leave, they run.
If, they don't study these writings by themselves , or nothing.
yes.
yes. it helps when someone starts to study, of what they believe, in their own religion.
is-yes,yes. like last time, I'm attending to a charismatic group. but, I'm understanding more, even though they saying it in Spanish, and I don't understand it, But i could speak Spanish, but i can't read it not even write it
then, they gave a Spanish bible as a present, and me,forgetting,that I'm reading it, but i don't know, then, I go and i explain them, I read this, and this, and this.
that is what it is, then, they read it in English to see if I understand them. but, it gets too difficult, the bible is, is
The bible, yes, the bible is difficult. The vocabulary that that use, anyways, it does matter the language, that I had found out.
exactly,exactly. that, I find it very hard, so , I, They give me passages, and then i read it, and then, they tell me,this is this, and this, and this
you know, and , and they start it to use it like we do, and , I said, oh , okay, Then, I understand.
Mm? Where are you from?
I'm Puerto Rican.
Puerto Rican. but raised in the United States?
yea. yea, yea, yes. I was born in Puerto Rico but i was raised in New york, Or whatever my place says. this places that they called it Manhattan.
Okay I don't know.
If, you know? if you from Georgia?
Oh, from Chile, ah, okay.
Oh, from Chile, ah, okay.
Yes I grew up, and I was raised in Chile, when I had finished high school, I came to study to the University,
but I'm going to flight.
United states, here.
Ah
And we've been here in Georgia, my husband and I, two years, but I've been in the United States, eleven years.
wow, wow, wow, wow.

Aha, That's good, that's good, to move like that. You see, I lived,
Aha yes.
I lived in Manhattan, then I lived in the Bronx, and now I moved to Long Island and we stayed here. Even though, when we retire, we are going to live I guess
in Florida. Because, my son, my older son and my grandkids live in Florida.
Ah, so then you are going to
So I would like to go, I would like to go to Florida to be near them. But, from now til I go, my grandson, might already be married.
Because, he's already seventeen, from now til I retire is ten more years, he'll be twenty-seven. Maybe he'll get married.
maybe, on another side, yes.
I'm going to be of the bis- I- Aha.
Ah. Yes, us, from here, who knows where we'll go. Because,

Oh. Oh, you're at home with your kids. Ah, that's good.
Mhm. I have two, two babies. One is one year old, and the other one is three.
Oh my God. Yes. yes. It's a lot of work. Right? I do ki- kid's parties. I dress up as a clown and now I'm trying to think how to make an Elmo head.
Because I have the, the bodysuit, but
Ah, yes.
the head belongs to my friend. So, she and I do parties. So, sometimes they ask for two, and we cannot go. Only one can go.
Ah.
So, I've been trying, my friend is making it, but the head is too heavy. So, I can't imagine how we're going to make that head.
So and, and through that, because, that's why I wasn't listening to what the lady was saying, because a tape of. And I say, oh, I'm doing too many things, I must concentrate
Everything at the same time, yes.
everything at the same time, because sometimes they call, and don't call, and, and sometimes I pick it up and I don't pick it up. And, and they had already, they had already given me this discussion last week, I don't know why they discuss the same thing.
Ah, yes?
Have you been doing this for a long time?
um, I've done it for ten i think eleven.

How much? How much time have you been in the United States?
I have five years already.
Five years and you speak English and everything?
yes, yes, already.  It is easy for me.
Did you get your citizenship or not yet?
It is the residency but because I have one more this four years married
Uh uh
then
But then after three years of marriage you can apply for citizenship
yes, but what happens is that I I don't know, dual citizenship, I have my citizenship in Venezuela and I have my Italian citizenship.
Because my dad is Italian.
Oh, oh, do you speak Italian?
yes, and then.
Yes.
I think I do accept the American citizenship they make me have
renounce now
exactly, citizenship and that doesn't convince me
Mm. The other two the two citizenships of but have investigated something over that because for example in Chile we now have the double citizenship could be United States citizenship.
yes but what happens is because I have two, they don't let you have three
You're in the right
See
it's a little difficult
yes.
Ah they're not. With the residency you're happy? your parents are
See
they live in Italy or in Venezuela or came here
No my mom, my parents live in Venezuela but my bother is like that of Italy. Lived in Italy.
okay, are your grandparents, your uncles are in Italy?
No uh uh in my part of my father yes
okay in Italy, I have some friends that live in Roma
Oh, no my family of my father are in Palermo. That is close in Sicily in the South the
it's pretty. I've seen photos of that place it's and I've seen pretty, pretty landscape of there
Uh uh
Beautiful, ¿and do you have animals, dogs, cats or something?
No, we don't have any, because we live in an apartment.
¿You're not allowed to have animals?
Permitted, all the neighbors have animals, but i don't feel well about having an animal locked all day in the apartment.
Right.
Yeah, ¿do you have animals?
Yes, i have dogs, and i have a cat.
Oh.
I have plants indoors, outdoors and i have an aquarium.
Oh.
I have a lot to entertain myself.
Exactly. My husband and i want to have a, a dog. But the thing is that, since we can't here, since we are in an apartment, and here there's no
Of the, yes.
No garden or anything.
But you can take it out, i lived in an apartment. I moved here six months ago. No, five monthg. And, and the... and i lived in an apartment for three months, with the dog, the cat and the plant.
And the aquarium, and i took my dog for a walk outside.
Yeah, the thing is we want to have a dog, but since it is a puppy dog.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, we're out all day, we're only here at night. We don't feel OK about leaving the poor puppy locked in the apartment all day.
Oh.
That is the question. But we are thinking in moving to be able to...
I see. Is you husband from the United States? or from Venezuela?
no, he is from here, from the United States
I see. Many are going to change soon.
Yes, we are looking forward to buy a house around here in order to...
To be able to move
yes to move, and hopefully, buy a little dog
To be in.. and not feel like this, we came just a month ago. To this house I'm talking about, my new house
And we had to fence the patio with cardboards to keep the little dog outside, well not that little, it's a labrador
Right
Them he goes in and out of the garage where we keep the door open, and he is in a space where he can play and run
Yes that's what I want, him to be able to go in and out, to be able to play in the yard and so. Not like this
And he has
Runs and so, exercises
and do you have an idea of...of which dog would you like?
yes, we are thinking of a 'uh' because
Oh, that's a small one
no they are rather medium
Which are these?
they look like a little bear, you know.
Oh, yes, yes, I know which one it is. They are beautiful and there are, what color do

Okay. Eh How old are you?
Twenty five
Twenty five
Mm, oh twenty eight
Okay. Sorry?
Twenty eight
Twenty eight, ah, me too
Ah.
Eh Well , to, to me, to me, I like all kind of mu-almost all kind of music, eh, except rap and hip hop
eh
Aha.
everything else, mm, both Latin and American. Eh, I like everything, I like rock in Spanish, in English, I like um music
classic opera eh dance a little bit of everything eh so
And And you?
Pardon?
and I specially like live music a lot.
How?
Live music.
Live? Eh. Like concerts?
Aha.
Eh, eh, not too much, eh I prefer more, what I do is that I search for music on the internet
Okay.
so, almost all the music I have, that I have, I have around five hundred -CDs that I have bought and
Aha.
a lot, there are a lot more that I've searched for on the internet.
Exactly.
ah so for, for me, I mean for me, I need music for everything I need it for when I'm working, when I'm studying
eh I always like to have music on, is what keeps me alert, I suppose, so for me yes, music,yes, extremely important
and is fundamental eh
Exa-
it helps me concentrate, it helps me relax, I think. To me, music can change your mood, yes, I can be
Exact-
very quiet and then I listen to a song and I can change to a bad mood or, I can be in a pretty bad mood and then I listen to a song that makes me cheerful.
Exactly, exactly, no, yes, me too, I because, no, eh, I play an instrument and my husband plays an instrument too so at least, ah, maybe in a festival or something
Okay.
there's a bar  near our house and lots of people come play every night, people just sit and play instruments.
and they have like open circles every night and they have songs where people come and play, so in the weekends, many different music groups come and play
play during the nights, on the weekends and that's so cool.
Okay. Eh, which type of music you like the most?
I like everything.
Do you dislike any music styles?
Eh, I don't like, or at least I don't like rap or hip-hop that much, I like Pop music, ah
yes, Britney Spears I don't like, I don't like her, it's not interesting to me.
Okay.
I like, ah, I like, ah, everything, Rock in Spanish, I've got a lot Rock in Spanish songs and bluegrass, so
Okay, do you have a favorite bands?
Well, I like, Fito Paez, it's Rock in Spanish
Okay.
He's from Argentina.
yes.
yes, I like him a lot.
Okay.
And, me like American music there's a man that his name is that he's very good
That
and the one that died oh that was also a very, very good singer but at least here, where I live, there's a lot of people that play
Oh.
many of our friends that play and sing and have bands
yes.
and all the groups that they have are, are very, very good also
Okay. For me, for me, well maybe I go to, to one or two concerts each year but no no I don't know,
in general the type of concert I go to the most is more eh, is rock, in English, and anyways, the people that go are more like
really young and is like too loud. That's why, for that, it doesn't appeal to much to me to go to those concerts.
Ah.
Well and I at least this year went to a concert of, oh, Willy Nelson
Aha.
and Bob Dylan
yes.
and there were people of all ages, there were people that were like sixty or seventy years old and there were even ten, eight year old kids in the concert
yes.
yes, and really nice. They do them in a small stadium, in a small baseball stadium and there weren't, there weren't that many people but
but yes it was very, very good, the concert
What, uh, do you buy music or do you have C-D's
Well, yes, more than anything we buy music but also we much music from groups, for this reason, no, no, they are not so popular, that is how it, people that we know
yes,
yes, because we are member of a, a, music society of folklore music in Philadelphia, so then at least there are a lot of musicians
that are members of do concerts in the houses all that, all the months
okay
there is a concert in, in a house of a member and we buy all those CD's
okay
of groups that we see, for this reason, if they are not, like very, very famous, but they are really good
okay
And sometimes, we have, have seen, groups that we
and
we did not know they were famous and all of a sudden we are listening to them, we were in a festival or something
yes
and all of a sudden we are listening to a song that is very famous
okay
but
the, and the, you say you play instruments, eh, is you, your husband play, like in a band, or a group?
No, no, no. My husband played before in a group, because that is that group is not together again, maybe they, they will get together again,
OK
but no, we don't play for any group, or sometimes my husband who plays with his friends but what happens is that we don't have time, so there is a lot like to
to, to commit like this with people
OK
because for work and that we don't, and, and then we don't have time to commit if, with a group because if you have a group, you have to practice at least one day
Practice and look for the
week
promotions and
OK.
yes.
Then, yes, you have to dedicate a lot of time, and he, at least there is a group that wants that my husband goes and plays with them
but where they get together, they get together Wednesdays at night like at ten at night and then practice like until two in the morning, on Wednesdays,
like they have to work and, in school and that, he doesn't have time
yes.  Ah, already, I, I would have loved to have eh eh to be able to play an instrument, but I am very bad at that but for me for me the
musi-, music that for me it is well, very necessary.  For me eh, I a- I, for me, I love it, I mean eh, I am, I can be ah
I, I remember songs of, of many songs of
Mm
songs that I can spend years without hearing and at the moment the in-, eh I hear the, the song again and after years I can, sing the complete song
For me that if it happens, that I if I go too much time without singing a song to me I forget.  But I, I was, the other time I was talking with a friend and
and we were with her, we heard a song on the radio that I had not heard for like eight years and she remembered the whole song
and after that they passed a song that i didn't listen for almost four years, all that time without hearing it and i knew the song and
he knew that i knew it but i couldn't remember the lyrics of the song but, i remembered a little, no much. I would have forgotten if not, if
i didn't listened all the time, forget the lyrics that's why, i know the song but the lyrics not that much
Ah, then, i, to me, to me it depends of, of what state of spirit i have, the go, like that and
like i have, like and iPod , you know wha iPod's are ?
Aha
Eh, for me then, eh, a have like ten thousand in, in that, on that iPod
Aha
and then i have almost all, have some, ah, a music list that only has music for, for, of bai-, of dancing dance music
Have a complete list that is, eh, only rock in, eh, in English that is, basically i use it for, when i go to the gym
Exac-
I have a list that is, eh, of only Spanish music on other list that only has like classical music, opera, things like
to relax
Ay, and for studying.
eh i have an, eh, a list, pu- eh on the contrary. To me eh, to be able to study i can't have that type of classical musci, i need music
Yes?
it should have lyrics because if it does not have, if it does not have lyrics makes me bored, I need something that entertains me
What, what are you studying?
Eh, Eh, with, work with virus
OK
In Biology
OK
this way is, always I need something to keep me entertained, something that takes my attention
Exactly
yes, yes, if I put music, it has to be no classical music
Mn
I, I got sleepy, I put Classical music when I have lots when I have eh, if I have to write a, a report I have to concentrate a lot, a lot, a lot
well, then but always since I was little always, when I had to study, I always listened to music and while singing, I could read and my father always made critiques about it
it is impossible for a persons to read and sing at the same time but I don´t know, for me it always worked, I always got good grades, so
I su- I suppose that
I had a female professor
no
that used to say that when no, when you are studying something that you have, something you have to learn if you sing the things you need to learn, you learn more
faster than reading in a normal way
yes, that does not, does not atract me at all, the music, I mean, eh, it can
hello, hello
hello, have you talked to Fabiola
and connected, so it will work
aha and that's how it works and you pay for it
oh, you should also see if
cool or not. and that is the issue I told you to bring up as a topic of discussion
then we must speak about memories
about the best thing that has happened in my life
ah
and how has it changed your life
okay
and what other good things happened in your life?
ahh Artas things
but it's the best thing that you feel has ever happened in your life
ahh
that's a good topic
if I met someone with children
yes
I think everyone meets someone else because they had not known not to
if I say the same
This children wouldn't be here
Aha, the best that ever happened to me was to meet my husband
Yes because like...
and the second and the other best that ever happened to me was to have my children
yes
Be healthy and being healthy
yes because if I wasn't met the guy, I won't, I won't be here
and really
Another weren't have those children, I wouldn't have met you either
yes
If it weren't for him, not even
why? Goods topics are good because you find good conversational topics when you talk here because they add music too. There was music yesterday
yes
eh, yes and it's enjoyable, you talk twelve minutes and they themselves cut you out.
Hey I like them
yes, they say you have thirty seconds left to say goodbye
ohh
And so we have twelve minutes to talk about whatever we want because they are checking our voices
but, eh, how it's called?, you mustn't talk about what they say to you
you must talk, you must talk about what they say you or whatever you want, the idea is to have a conversation because that's all, all the conversation is being recorded
oh, so later the computer can know that uh
Who is who
and therefore, by the accent,
by the accent, the system, is the way of speaking and
mm
the tone of voice and they are inventing something
yes, for the
so then, they need people that have different voices
oh, no idea, and I had not called because, I say, no I could not call.
and the
much earlier
yes, the little ones, all connect through this number
yes
yes, they speak at the same time, at the hour.
ehh
and, and they connect well they connect well
I'm, I'm going to try then to call after, later, or at midday maybe, I don`t know
yes, but I know if you can make two calls at the same time
the same day
yeah, that I don't know, I hear the voice of the children beautiful
if you hear it it's because they are here, they are
it can be heard very, super clearly, yeah
both are laughing
they are, and what are you doing to them that is making them laugh?
they are, they are both here sitting on my legs, and are in front of each other and they look at each other and laugh
they look at each other, and laugh and they say, hey you look like me, no, no, no, you look like me
and one is, is that they have the pacifier tied to the bib so then he is pulling the pacifier that the other one had and he pulls it like this
children are funny, ooh, they are growing. And do you talk to them?
oh,
Do you have to talk to them now or not?
What?
if talk to them, do you talk to the children?
yes, yes, I talk to them, yes I talk to them, I talk to them all the time, and I talk to them in
in English?
in Spanish
ohh,
and you do you talk to them in English
in English, that's great because they will understand both languages
yes, because yes, yes, they grow up with both languages
yes,
Because, and they also grow up with a, not having accent.
him, imagine me, a Geni, with the two languages also, uh, he speakes to me in both languages, uh, he can now read both languages but he also has an accent and he has trouble with spanish.
Uh
And despite that since little and had her first three years, born here
M
but at two months and half, i took her to Chile and it was the same at Chile
¿and where did she learn to speak?, ¿did she learn to speak when she was in Chile?, yes well
it's that she learn just words, she couldn't say complete phrases because him
Ohh
we came here every year on vacation and a month here
Oh
and the dad always spoke to her in English
oh, so she was kinda confused
and of course, and then, uh, he and when she listened, she listened a bad Spanish from Michel
m
or a bad English from me
oh
now i speak a better english, Michel speaks a better Spanish and she can now read both languajes and she's better, but they do get confused when the dad
speaks with an accent and with a strong accent
the, the wrong I'm doing, i mean, i speak to them in Spanish but the problem is that for example, when i'm with another person and they speak English
i talk to them in English you see
isn't that bad?
why not but maybe it's bad because no because my accent isn't understood
not good, no
and i know they're little now they're not going to, not going to talk now but that oh maybe it's all getting recorded there then
yes from four months on before kids start to
it's just that
and you have planned what are you going to do for Christmas or thanksgiving?
for thanksgiving we're going to go with my, with Armi's grandparents come to eat because my
i see
my mother-in-law is fixing the house
yes
so we're going to have to go where his grandparents and them together
for Christmas are you already planning the gifts and everything?
what?
the gifts are you planning for Christmas or not?
hmm no, not yet, not yet no
not yet
and you?
me the kid- the kids are already big for the Christmas they're going to play
yes
that's beautiful
do you already have plans for Christmas?
ah I'm thinking of buying, we'll buy a tree
m
we bought a live one every year
eh
um, we're going to see if Michael doesn't look at a new car
for real?
yes
a real car or what
a large remote control car
ahh
it's usually one hundred and sixty dollars, but I found it on sale for fifty dollars
and what type of car is it?
the same as James Bone
ohhh
but the James Bone remote control car I'll put as a gift from Santa Clause
huh?
for Jenny I still having found anything, she really wants and would love a Game Boy for Christmas
m, oh okay
that you, that doesn't use little keys you touch the little things and it starts moving
yes
one super, super new that came out
oh
so that I think that I am going to put that one so that she that I know what is it that she wants
and what did you give her on her birthday?
and a karaoke.
a karaoke  and do you play with it or not?
aha yes it sings, it is good, because at the age she is at they are reading at the same rate that the letters come out and they go getting darker, changing color
m
then it is singing the song
ohh
and yes she is entertained a ot and I tell her that it is good so she can read faster those it is, it is super good for Christmas and to, to my father-in-law
I bought ehm a gift on behalf of Jonathan
m
that is a
for the
for the computer, it has ehm to move the mouse
ehm?
Move the mouse and it has a calculator
Does the mouse have a calculator?
No No No, the part where you move the mouse it´s a little square.
that one. the little thing made out of plastic.
and that
Oh, Ok.
So I bought one for my father in-law and one for us.
hey?
hey? I believe that´s a good idea.
Are they going to be there for christmas?
No, We already bought the bus tickets, We are going to go to Arkansas for about a week.
a week.
mhm, Every year we go for one  week.
Oh. Cristina was thinking of goign back to Chile for work.
Oh yeah.
And that din´t work out well.
No, but It hasn't started yet.
but, she said that maybe no. who knows why?
So no one really knows what would happen.
mm
they told him that it's, that they have staff in case of anything that could happen that they will let know
yes
it's like we'll call you later
something like that
but it turns out that he still hasn't started his job in Chile
ahh
it's still, I got excited to I told Michel, Michel if you get it we'll go
he'd go
Michel yes yes but
m
Oh um its the same thing i think, but how are we going to leave, if we recently bought this house, how? he says.
um
we will sell it, and it makes me laugh because for him its really easy to get rid of things.
and it costs me so much work.
why did it cost you so much, you found that house.
yeah, then i had to decorate it, i haven't even put on curtains , I'm getting closer little by little.
huh?
we bought them in JCpenny
m
we are getting everything by different parts, we first got the curtains, i received the other part last night, the top part.
huh?
then i got the other top part, and i still need, three more curtains, they haven't arrived yet.
and they are? are they the living room curtain?
the living room curtains because i haven't put on the outer window part yet.
Oh you haven't put on the outer window part?
no because the rest of the house got it put on, but the living room not, because they are not actually windows.
ahh
so, there's no such thing for that kind of size, you have to make one yourself.
specially for it
Hello,
Hello
Who's speaking?
My name is Anny
Hello Anny, I'm Arturo
Hello Arturo
Where are you calling from?
From Miami
From Miami, very good I speak from
from where?
Philadelphia
Philadelphia
yes, Where are you from?
Eh, Puerto Rican
Ah, okay
And you?
I'm Mexican
ah,
yes
are you studying here in the United States?
yes, exactly
Good,
did you study or work?
No, I have a child of twenty three months and I've had her for four days now
Oh, how cute
so no, I'm working but not
yeah, well, of course
No outdoors
yes, of course, there's much work in the house I guess
yes,
Very happy that's good, but I guess not
yes, I'm a little tired now but happy
if the child is four days
Four days
wow a little bit
yes,
And this young man heard that, that you live in the US? have you lived there all your life?
yes, eh, my parents are from the Dominican Republic
Okay
And in 1970 something, or whenever it was
mh mhm
ah, I think it was sixty-three, I'm not sure
mhm
But a revolution in Santo Domingo
Okay
And they went to live in Puerto Rico
ah, okay
Then they spent twenty years there
aha
Then, my sister when she went to college came here to the state of Florida Then we moved to Miami
ah, okay
And I was about I think I was five years old
ah, very little
yes my sister kept me for ten, eleven years
ah, okay
Then we, you know, we left and
yes,
eh, I, went to school here and you know We made a life here
yes, yes, I understand
And
And now you are married with, is with Latin, or with an American?
an American
oh, Okay, I see.
yes, I met him at the University
oh, okay from there in, in Miami I supposed
No, eh, I went to
Oh, okay
In
Okay
So then, I met him there
Oh, I see, that's great
So then,
And
after the, oh,
And what, and what language you speak with, with, with your, well right now you don't even speak, your children because
well,
He is twenty-four months, the other one
eh, the, has twenty-three months and the other one has four days
Twenty-three, yes, this one can´t
I, what we do is that when he is not here, in, my husband is not in the house
mm
I speak full Spanish to my daughter
okay
Then when he is here we speak full English
Ah , okay
So she can learn both languages
identify them
And, and I get surprised because a lot of times she says things
Ah, yes
that I even didn't notice she already learned
Ah, really
It can be in English or Spanish
wow, aha
So she is getting it
very fast
yes,
also no, so at what age do kids start talking normally, I don't really know
And mm I think it was, she was, let's say fifteen, sixteen months
okay
As she is learning English and Spanish
aha
Eh, it takes for children that do that, it takes a little more time of talking
yes, yes
My girt caught it you know, and her friends or whatever, the little friends
yes,
Eh, they speak cleary and more than her
yes
ah, until recently
ah
Then now her, I knew she is, she understoo y could talk
yes, but
But having the two languages it was a little more difficult
sure, yes, it should be a lot more difficult, but, well I believe, well in the long term it is going to be very good also, no? that way you grow up with two languages and that is a strenght
yes, yes
the truth
Then, eh, but, you know, her, I know she understood
mm
What I was saying in English and in Spanish
yes, yes, I imagine
And now, you know, particularly I know that she understands me because when there is something she does not want to do she act like a fool, and you know
yes
I see her face and I know she understands, exactly
yes, of course, but the kids, they're very astute later, later, aren't they
yes, yes
you know
so, but you know, she understands it, she talks it
hmm
and
well yes i hope it goes on like that because then when she starts growing and more of her friends speak English well they're going to practice english i think aren't they
yes and no, huh, we aren't sending her to school, we're going to do homeschooling
oh OK
because i am, i was a teacher
ah
so i think that for me to go to work and teach to, you know, sons or kids of someone else, for that I'd rather stay home
aha
and I can teach my own kids
yeah that's true
so that
but but and what do you think about i mean that she's not going to have school friends, that, that
well
That is an experience too no, i mean
yes you have many programs here in miami, for the people that teach their children in home
OK
then normally once in a week, they put them together
ah OK
then its like a school, it can be like lets go say the class in church or in an university, or whatever, but is like a school you have to go once in a week
oh, OK
so you know also with your friends and everything else, i have many friends and family members that have do that
the
mmm, and they have no problem
ahh OK
but you know there isn't something
yes
because that's my worried too, i want she has friends and friendship and all that
yes sure that is what i was thinking because if i mean a part of the experience of be in the school is get to know people
yes yes
then i think so, that is important, that it doesn't matter when you are a kid, because its true that you're friends are very relevant
yes yes
i don't think so
yes yes
But yes as long as you have contact with other people at least one week but
And also you know, they have sports the, of eh the eh, I mean the community places
there is much, it is that here there is a lot of contribution from the community, of course and that
yes, so you know, things like that it is how they it is like they say, they socialize themselves
yes, I see
So that, you know,
yes, yes, yes, yes I like I mean in Mexico this is not common you understand, it doesn't happen at all
yes,
Then I don't know people like that who has come out of that type of schools, you understand, in and always I am very curious as to how they do it here in the United States, because here it is much more common, there are many people that
That comes out of school at home oh, well at least before now I don't know
yes, he, the, this you know, it is like any other experience, it is like a the the tak, you know, it can be good it can be bad
yes, yes, yes, yes
But I also think that like schools are here, also are like the kids
yes they can be very bad too, true
yes that, that also I would like that if she has you know, friends and all these things, but at the same time I think that I have to protect her
yes, of course, but you have to be careful because then it is bad about protecting them.
yes, yes
It can be very bad
yes, not I, but for that reason it is that I want to teach because I can teach him anything, but it depends how I present it to him
yes,
yo know,
yes, yes
is a little different that, let's say how they present it in school
yes, that's true and until what grade you have planned to do the homeschooling
ahm, don't know eh, I didn't think of that as she has only two years
yes
And i didn't start
Time will tell
yes, so then
How do you think, so you, you think teaching all elementary or what
ah, could be probably until, until, at least until sixth grade
Okay
Then from there, then let's carry on because i don't know, you know, i , i can teach her until she reaches High School
Ah, yes
ah,
Then you have, have taught even in high school or what ?
yes yes
well, and on what subjects more than anything
Eh, right my, i was a special education teacher
aha
And so I was teaching everything.
Ah, okay, I see.
And just so that you know, the only thing that I, if I didn't know something
Uh huh.
If I don't know the issue or whatever, well then I would teach myself so that I would be able to teach the children.
Alright, okay, I see.
So then you know, like things, like say algebra
mm
It's not that I don't know, but it can also more possible that I just had forgot
yes,
Because if I don't use ut
aha
Well eh, you know, well before teaching the class, what I was doing was that I was that I as I was remembering
mm
It was what I had to do.
Yes, of course.
So that I could teach them.
Ah, okay.
Well you know for me that isn't very hard, I know that for other people it can be hard but for me
yes but, it's like that because I say already in high school they are beginning to specialize more in subject areas for instance, chemistry is more advanced and physics is more advanced.
And also that time, I know that now
aha
they even classes of, that the children can take or the children can take on the computer
yes,
and they can go to, a high school we're going to say on the internet
yes,
so you know, there's many, many, many, options that isn't really of
yes, yes, yes
You know, that one has to
yes, no
to put them in a public school also
mhm
you know, I know that the university here
mhm
They have classes for children also, in high school that they can take in the University
yes, yes I hate that
So you know, we have many options
Much very good much luck
and what
But if you say also, you're only have two years there isn't a need to think of that
No, but as my husband says, you know, that I'm a teacher.
right.
And I'm always reading books, I'm, you know, singing songs.
mmhmm.
So she's not, you know, having fun but at the same time, I'm always learning something.
Yes, right.
So you don't know if I am giving formal schooling.
Ok.
But if I'm giving you or I'm raising.
mmhmm.
Little by little, she knows her ABC's, well, at she knows the song.
Yes, if you read.
Yes, right, then she knows. her numbers.
yes.
A little, you know, if I say one she can tell me two, three, then next to me she says, you know that eight comes after seven, you know things like that.
yes, if you know the order.
yes, if not all, little by little
yes, that's good.
so you know, so
yes, sounds, sounds pretty interesting.
yes
That I don't know anything, I don't know how That is yes I was in that situation, I  don't know how I would do because I never would have imagined how
to give classes to my son myself I could not do it, because I also tell you the truth I am not so Imean Ehm, I didn't have an education on how to give classes, do you understand me
hmm
I imagine that you must have studied something like about Education or something like that no?
Well ehm
or what did you study?
I studied education if but they didn't teach me exactly like to teach let's say how to teach a child how to read
yes, no
All of those things I had to learn when I was working
aha
So I am using that experience
sure, sure, sure that you got all of the the schools gave classes
yes, But for that reason, is that you, you know, for me For me to do with the with my With my children
hmm
It is not a problem because I already have the experience, I don't know, you know How the other people does it
My name is Mariza
Hello, Good afternoon, My name is Lorena, I'm here in San Antonio, Texas
Hello
Hi eh, Today's topic is frankly touching huh?
yes, It also took me effort to think what was the best and what the worst
Exactly, now I said, well it's going to be the memories, I said well, the memories are like precisely the most important thing that life can bring you, because one lives, like, of memories, right?
Exactly, with so much, eh, with so mu- I don't know, as time goes on, there are more memories, I don't know, I wouldn't know which one to choose to begin with
ah
for example the best
That is, the very best I'm a mother
yes me too
And maybe yes, If I wanted to think what's the best that ever happened in my life, maybe that is, have had my children, I remember that in the very moment I was birthing them I said, this is the best that ever happened  in my whole life, then I want to
Of course
I want to be consistent, say with that comment that I made myself up in the very moment it was happening, but however there are other
marvelous things and maybe only one can't be selected true?
sure that is what I was thinking, and also I was wondering if that never happened how different your life would have been, in your case, if you wouldn't have had children
yes, yes, yes then I would not have liked it
is, is
because, because they're now grown up, they bring me, well, so much beautiful things, that maybe by myself it wouldn't be enough to bring me so much memories and so much
ehm, positive and negative emotions, then all isn't beautiful too, no, precisaly I have a son that, that have some pro, a health problem, and that is painful too
yes
and it's good but maybe my emotions are more loving, more tender and more eh good and this the husband, right, husband
yes, and if not then the children, the children
they also have much, much to do
yes
in, in one's life, no, and this
no
but I, I would think that there may be nothing more than a just a single event
clearly,
now a painful event, a painful memory of the death of my mom for example
clearly the death of a family or a loved one has to be one of the worst that can happen to anyone
yes yes, yes or illness of my son, too, not that well
that too
is very painful, but as I say, one can not say that only one eh, but nice try not to think about it
clear as the second part of the question, was that, that's been had most of your life that no, it had not occurred, the negative or painful echo
eh yes
or would not that person would now still in my case, my mom lives, but my, my grandparents both died long ago
and had no chance to say goodbye to them or because they lived far away, then maybe the series would have been if my life would have been different had it not because of course they could not meet my husband or my daughter either.
then it is yes
exactly, exactly mhm
Sure, life would be so different
Uh um, your husband, you met him ¿where?
Here, in the United States, almost by chance
Right, because you are Spanish
And, yes, I'm Spanish
Right, yeah
And i came here to study, but i met him and i ended up staying, and I've been here for twelve years
Right
And, nothing, i have a five year old daughter, i couldn't say my life has changed, sure, because children change your life, but she's so little, she has so much future
Yeah, of course, yeah
And then, nothing, i don't know, it's different when children are older, they are more independent, but i still have to go through that
Yeah, yeah, and, and really, it's a lot of stuff and so many stages
And, right
But, but well, at this age, when they're little, that's the most lovely
Yeah, the, yeah, everybody tells me the same
Uh, um, it's the most lovely, and, well, now, when they grow up and they live on their own, well, for example, that's nice, but you don't get the
"hi mom, i did well in this", and "hey mom, well this", that's more like a conversation level, like at a level
there's not much dependence, there's not much closeness
Yeah
But, but it's nice, it's really nice, and then, ¿what's the best that has happened to you, your best memory?
Well I think that, as you said, having, having children, well, I have only one and I don't think, I don't now if I'll have more
yeah
it was, I mean I don't think I was ready to be a mother, maybe because it was a very big change, and the pregnancy was very difficult
we, we've raised her, my husband and I here all alone, then it was a little difficult, but, sure, having a child changes your life, so it's the best thing that happened to me, I say
by now
yes
eh, it can't compare to anything else, I say
yes, right, right now, for me it's been immediate too, I thought that since I've had good times, you'll have nice memories in life, of every achievement you had
sure
well, as a person, or in sports, or in academics, or at work, no
sure, and that's why, the other question was what would have been different if that didn't happen, and I think that if I wasn't a mother, my life would be very different
I might have finished school, I might have
yes, right
sure, I might have gotten a more important career, or traveled more, or met someone else, but of course you never know, you can only imagine
exactly, exactly, and nevertheless you start accumulating
yes but
memories in pictures of Christmases, and in pictures of school festivals, and in pictures of your kids' sports festivals
oh
it's like, piecing together this life, because it's like it's made of memories, no
exactly, yes, all the pictures I have, thousands and thousands, are all of my daughter, that's why the
it's easy to say that it's the most important, eh because apart from that it's clear, apart from that well I don't know, I have traveled a lot, I have met interesting people but I don't know how to compare with
with children, I suppose
mhm yes because this is like very, like very complete like very you don't study to be a mom, you don't study to be
no
a human being you don't study to learn to love but at the end how is it that the deepest emotion and the most complete, no
yes, as I say to my sister that she doesn't have any children and I tell her, until you become a mom, you won't know how to be a woman, let's just say
complete because they have, they've been married twenty years but no, she doesn't have any kids, I don't don't thing that they will have any, and then it's hard to explain
it's difficult to explain them
it's very difficult to explain because one is not as they say
but, but one says that it's good that I had them, because I would not have liked to miss it
yes, I had him for that reason I say I turned thirty years old, and I say well now I think that it's time to or now or, or, or we have one now or when I'm older I don't want to have it because
sure to raise a child you need to have a lot of patience, a lot of energy and a lot of
a lot of energy, that's right
of everything, yes, yes and my daughter is eh she does require a lot of patience and a lot of sacrifice
aha
and
yes, yes, in truth, and she for example because, because she's very mischievous
she's very active, very hyper-active and eh I don't know she's not a girl like I was when I was little, that I was quieter, and I did everything my parents told me, she's not, she's more
shes like like three, sometimes it's
yes, yes yes
I finish tired, after every day but well, she is like that, she is like that, you have to accept children as they are
that's how it is yes, yes, yes
and
and this and then you understand a lot why eh they are like that and everything that is going to allow them to achieve a strong character and very active, no
yes I think that, or I hope that she
she is going to achieve many things I think
yes yes, when I compare with my niece, they are so different, I think my daughter I don't know, she has a stronger character maybe that will help her in the future to move forward
yes, with, with all the difficult things that are ahead, challenges
of course
no, I have a daughter the younger one who is a little like that and she is in addition to being very good with school stuff well she is an excellent athlete.
exactly yes, that is what we want, we want that my daughter also do some sort of sport but we want to wait until she is a little older because she is five I don't know maybe she is too young but
she has the body let's say to be an athlete and maybe that will help her to develop more and
her character to be able also
yes
like to guide, no mm
and, and maybe she calms down
and that they get tired
yes, yes I need that because sometimes we go to sleep before her, we can't like that anymore yes
yes, yes yes they need to get tired, what a crazy thing
I don't know there is they tell me it is the age
where do you live?
right now in Philadelphia
oh philadelphia, my daughter is attending the university of pensylvania in Philadelphia
oh what a coincidence, that's a good college
yes sure, its in Philadelphia
yeah, this is a town where lots of people come to study, many young people, its one of the most important ones, and that's also important, education
oh, yes
yes, sure
of course I would like my daughter to go to the University, but that will be many years from now
yes but she will do it for sure. What did you study?
Me, Criminal Justice, well Psychology but I didn't finish my studies
aha, aha
afterwards I got pregnant, the girl, we want to raise her at home we don't want to take her to a daycare because we want to, I don't know, it's the traditional way, like I was grown up, my parents kept me home
mhm, mhm
we don't want to leave her alone at a daycare
well that's a good decision
yes, it's good
I support it. You need to take a lot of vitamines to have all the energy necessary
yes, as long as you can, right now, yes
and you will see in some time, my little daughter was fifteen yesterday
wow
and then, when you look backwards, you'll have much more memories, much more experiences of all her achievements, which are also yours because
they achieve things thanks to the support they parents can give them and their devotion, not like you say as you are leaving aside
maybe your more personal things, your career, your profession
yes
Well my name is Claudia Ivette.  With whom do I have the pleasure?
Hello my name is Juan
oh nice to meet you Juan
my pleasure as well.  Where are you?
From where, what?
ah, where are you
eh I am here in the state of Idaho
aha
this is a place called Robert this.  And you where are you speaking from?
ah OK I am in Texas, in San Antonio
wow a little far
aha there we are mmh
yes yes well you see that they have placed us you see that we have the subject of movies
no yes
well I have I those ratings I don't I don't understand very well, I know that there are movies that are -PG thirteen - PG
aha
and the truth is that I have seen some that really have more curse words that are -PG three- eh eh they are more like more violent and more
more like that they are the -PG the - PG than the -PG thirteen I have noticed
aha ah
then well I don't understand much about that
well hmm pay attention that I have not aha I have not paid much attention to those, to those classifications.
aha
I end up no understanding them very well either
aha
I think that they are ehm, a little complex, better yet they should have a little more information of what is it that they have.
yes, yes it is true
no btu in general since I don't have small children anymore
aha
ehm children well I don't worry much
aha
by those classifications I worry more in every case, for when are we going to see a movie that is a movie that is worth it, that has something interesting and not go to any movie then the classification
aha
it doesn't interest much like the quality and the comments that I listen about the movies, no
aha
that is that is what calls my attention a little more, it is- I don't know if the same would to you, you always go with you go alone or go with someone
No I am married, I have been married for three years and to tell you the truth I do have, a child, he is twenty months old
aha
then he barely is going to be two years old and yes the truth that worries me what we do, well my husband more than anything
he for example if we see some movie and we really love it, we like the movie for example if it is_PG or PG thirteen
aha
this is what we see the most, we don't really like it, we dont like adult movies.
ha
So pg thirteen
oh yes
maybe once in a while, rated r but it actually doesn't get my attention, for example if there is one we like,
yes
we buy it and it has for example naked scenes of people, and my husband hates that, so he skips that part.
oh
So he does it so he can show us that we shouldn't watch that stuff, cause the kids could grab the movie and watch it themselves.
And then my husband would film a commercial or something like that.
ha
so really there could be a movie about cars or action.
yes
but for example he skips it, he skips the pornographic part, because there is always a naked person, in every good movie.
yes
and sometimes there's nothing to watch
there's always something
we have action movied, about cars and out of nowhere there's a scene that has nothing to do with it.
yes, that has nothing to do with it, yes
so, that's what he does cause we are going to have more kids, so when they're alone we can be OK and relaxed cause they wont watch those movies.
There won't be a problem, but
Yes, yes, I believe in that sense you can be very right
Yes
Pay attention to me, because curiously
Yes
that which worries me the most in movies is the language and violence
Yes, because in reality
regularly because like you say when there is an exaggeration en the language
Yes
or in the violence then everything else is the same
Yes
so when the movie is like this rated R, well obviously it is going to have all kinds of scenes
No yes
those are free, so rather rated R seems more than restrictions it seems like if you don't have much information about the movie it is exaggerated in all its elements
Yes y apart for example, we have found movies that are this for kids or in other words are not from kids but to see are
passing from the rating for kids which is of course PG-13 which is for kids that are thirteen years old that they can watch but sometimes they says like you say vocabulary and sometimes scenes occur
of nudity and stuff, so I say good
Yes
I don't know, I am Mexican
Mhm
this and really there, for example, television still takes some care, and even in the movies they the care themselves a little bit
yes, because that
but I think, well, I don't know, it becomes really
remembering the movies we have seen recently
really fast
PG-13 or similar, i don't know where he got it, because the ones we have here
yes
available at the cinema are not
yes
are not, good,
yes
then, we get worried a lot about the information, and my children are teens now and we always go the movies together but
yes
we go primary because the quality of the movies, then
yes
it that way, the classifications they have to orientate us, well, it doesn't provide real information, they don't
Sometimes they don't tell you anything, because sometimes it tells you
We don't care about i
and changes your things and,when you're watching well, it's different what is saying
yes
Oh yes for example she says that it's not too violent at times it's not too violent, simply not sometimes she doesn't, doesn't really give the information
so sometimes not
aha
and one doesn't even pay attention, better, because because no and those for example
yes, no eh
those am things that they sell for example to sell on the television devises that that already see that this
that
that take out the swear words or things like that and sometimes they don't work, but sometimes they don't, don't work very well let's say I rea- well I really don't have one
but I have a friend that has one and really she says that it hasn't, hasn't worked very well because sometimes it blocks swear words that ah, words that are not so rude and it leaves swear words.
yes
so uf
listen, yeah, in that case when we for the children's education
aha
we have never made act, censorship actions, we
yes
what we have tried is that when there are strong scenes we try to comment on them, no
yes
we talk about them and decide if ti was well regularly it's when we worry and we say listen, it was not necessary, there's no point in having used such ugly language
yes yes
no we, we analyze and then we take use it as part of our children's education.
yes
In general it works very well because, or should I say it worked, because they're all grown up now
yes
and what happens at this point, is that he has very good judgement about movies, and
yes, that's true, that's a better idea, I remember that my mom, when we watched a movie, we didn't see a movie after 10 pm because
we knew what we could find
yeah
or my mom would take the risk of finding an ugly movie
yeah
the kind that's not suitable for children, but for example sometimes she said, I don't know, they were showing a movie, and it had one or two curse words
yes
or something else that's no so much about nudity, but just the same, little clothing for example, and when we were little, for example my mom
yeah
no, daughter, soon you'll understand better, she said
yes
because if you say no, turn around, no, no, you must not see that, then a teenager or a kid will start thinking, ah, but why won't mom let me see that?
sure
If it's a movie in the house, and I'm going to watch it, why didn't mom, didn't mom let me see that part
yes, and they will find something like that on the way, they're always going to have a chance to see all that
then I think not, yes, yes
but what, what we are speaking about in these questions is that censure or the information that that supposedly should be censured
yes
these types of things for I've never thought have been good because
no, I think what
well there is a lot of information about the movies that it's convenient to go see with the family
yes
and after the movie to talk about what happened and educate in turn about what type of movie, the message, the quality in which it was said etcetera etcetera
yes yes that is true
because the restrictions that they place well like you said there is a lot of violence in the cartoon
yes
there is cartoons that are for all children and there are some that have exaggerated violence
and yes and that is in plain day the truth
yes exactly and in general I think that eighty percent of the movies are so bad that they shouldn't be seen
yes ya ya no
yes and the others well at least some are in the middle and some less than fifty percent are worth seeing
yes
no, well with those there is enough to have an idea of what there is to search for no
yes
yes there is enough, I don't want to say that there isn't enough movies, but there are so many that we don't have to see all of them, it's it's
yes that
no and then
that too
if we got to know for example of who they before going to see a movie
aha
over that girl in the movie and over it then we go
yes
is not, that is what we always try that we see the movie
aha
we already made a decision, over what movies and from, my sons had from early, they had that education because we like  going see a movie to a cinema, then
aha
never even when they were, like smaller
yes
if we had some movie sometimes we took the with us even if it was for adult only, no
aha
and yes they could see some scenes, not too strong, but the scene doesn't make the movie necesarily
aha
then we tried talking about the message, for example not too many war movies no
yes
lots of was movie for example are respecting the soldier
yes, good evening.
Good Good evening I am Jose
What's your name?
Joe
Joe?
yes, and what's your name?
Alex.
Alex. where are you from?
Ah, eh, I'm here in Los Angeles I think we spoke before about religion.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course, I remember, I remem-
We spoke on October the fourth, a long time ago.
Eh, what a memory, yes, I remember, of course.
Where are you from again?
I am from Colorado. Ah, Denver, Colorado.
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, and what do you think about tonight's topic?
Ah. I, I watch television through, through quality, not, not classifications.
yes, me too, I don't pay much attention to the classification, apart from an adult grading no, of course because I have a girl that
always here paying attention of what they watch in I don't want her to watch programs that eh, that would give her nightmares or bad, ah motivations but there are many
many permissive things too in the fore example, the movies outside, well more and more they are, I now think that it's more violent. I don't know if
It's enough to rate it, because they're making very violent movies about many subjects
yes. No, I, I think that I'm interested in, in movies, and TV through the subject that, that they broach
yes
Now if it's a violent subject, and it doesn't have quality, it's not a good movie. But if it has some violence, and, and it's teaching us something
like a documentary or something from real life, then it has value
Sure
because you cannot deny the truth of life
Sure
You cannot live your life with blind eyes
Like that movie that's, the one about the war in Iraq that, I think, it's about soldiers that, the experience they're going through
with that african-american actor, Jamie what's-his-name, I think Jamie Foxx
yes
and then you have this other white kid, who is traumatized, or something when he's in his experience, and in Irak. Those things are very real, they happen everyday over there
And those movies can also be political criticisms
yes, true
the Bush Administration, it's always been an administration that's obsessed with war
yes
with Irak, and deceiving the public
yes, transferring many things outside, the lie he said to invade Irak, that's really, uh, now that you look at it, it really is not
it wasn't worth it doing that, more than two thousand soldiers have died during all that
T-. th-, those movies are important because the majority of the people are ignorant on the things that happened to the peo-, in life
because there is no information.
yes, it is true.
The information that, that we obtain everything is propaganda, so it is important to see other versions of what is going on in the world, not just the Bush's administration version.
yes, it is true.  Well I, I think that the thing about the classifications nowadays is very relative.  I know that they have from thirteen, they know clearly that the - X are
obvious right?  But ehm I think that the - R or, those days it is very stretched what is allowed or not.  Ehm, ehm, I agree that
many movies, right? that don't make any sense for example, there are many movies about gang members that that the gang members many gang members are the ones that go to see it because since
Hmm.
need to see the violence.
Those movies are bad.
yes, they are very bad.
Because they teach violence
And like it glorifies in a certain way.
yes and, and they do it above all not for value, they do it to sell
And that is not to sell to
to certain people.
yes, that is why I see sometimes young kids like that replicating the way in which the dress or or how the walk or how they express themselves or ho-, because those are their hero
and that is not right, that ehm, corrupts youth.  Those programs, those movies teach fa- false values and and that is not right but also
the society, the parents, the family has a lot to do in helping the children to understand those things and and how to  send them, right?  And I with my daughter, I do not, when
I am watching something yes I don't want her to see something, I no eh, and that is, I do not force it in a way saye- saying, okay do not watch that
or rather that, I try to teach her in an educative manner because it's not good for her to be this program, instead of forcing it upon her, in other words.
Uh, I, I also have a fourteen year old son.
Mhm.
and every time that he comes to visit me I have to lock the sex channels.
Oh yes
yes, because he is obsessed with that, because when I leave I go to work and he sees that.
yes, it's easy to
So well then I have blocked him, so that he's not able to do it, because I have it all control, but I have to control it because I took the initiative to control him.
yes.
And not according to the censor labels. It's job each father and mother to make sure the television that the children are going to watch is protected and not just to blame the censor categories.
yes, exactly. Well, in, in my case I have basic cable and it's like, there's no channel that would pass my test
Do you have teenagers?
I don't, no my girl's only fine years old
Ah, yes, a little girl.
well eh, it has or rather, there's a Disney channel that she loves to watch and also we watch the Discovery Channel that she likes, and there's others
a comedy show that if we're not somewhere else we both sit down to watch it together and she really likes to laugh, she likes the funny shows
but when there are things a little bit more mature, or they get a little bit more risque, well I didn't let her watch it because I don't want that she should learn about such undesirable things.
That's what they doing entertaining when, it's, it's not eh, so morally correct, or wh-, or socially correct.
Yes, you can teach the children but, the, the, the truth is that a parent also shouldn't ignore, especially when
they are going to grow up and have the opportunity to be tempted by a lot of things we never had.
yes, e-
It's not because we are good parents but because of the culture
The culture is more
nowadays, the culture that the teenagers have is like, gangs, hip-hop music, lots of sex, lots of violence
The videos.
the videos.
yes, all those things
ah, it's not easy to try and control all that, you can try, I try to explain him what the consequences of doing these things are
and if he goes and have sex with this girl, well this are the consequences, this can happen to you, do you understand?
yes.
You have to talk to them often because I've seen so many things, I'm a substitute teacher
yes.
and lots of parents take good care of their children when they are five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten years old but then, when they are getting older, they need more help and parents
they start to make lots of mistakes then, and the teenagers are tempted and
teenagers are in a critical age.
that's the time when they have to be involved in their teenager's life.
Exactly..
and not only when they are five or six years old.
It's a way of reasoning and thinking, that's what they say, we were teenagers too, I remember that I used to be like that too
that I was a rebel and all those things but that's when one needs to guide parents.
E- exactly. Exactly.  Then everything depends on the parent's education and the way how they are involved in the life of the youngster no, not to the, not to the classifications
the classification is only a number
yes and one comes to see when they are alone with their little friends they can see whatever they want since nobody is prohibiting that
yes
Eh but if one helps providing a good argument in, in a tale of what is good and what is bad that helps to think a lot before acting
making incorrect action
We should give foundations to the young, what is good and what is bad, not only when they are five or six years old but also when they are fifteen, sixteen, eighteen years old.
Exactly
and it is more important when they are fifteen years old than when they are five, because when they are five they are going to follow easy rules
yes
but when they are fourteen or fifteen years old, the story is other, my friend
and they believe they are more independent, that they don't need parents
already, already have freinds, already, already are involved in culture
yes
the father or the mother have to work, not always tehy have the time, it is very difficult
yes, the influence of the young people today is very big and I agree, despite remembering that I also have my influence as a friend when, when I was young and that
but I can see why the technology and all that is even bigger.  Because the movies when I was young were not as violent as they are now.
there were no video games, the televison used to be much more restricted, no the did not teach this modern violence, not the blood or de body like C S or I and all the programs are picturesque, classic
they teach things like they are reality
Mhm
Well it's like that, for the youth they become mentally accustomed to that being acceptable but back when I was growing up, if they would have shown those things it would have caused an uproar.
in fact they wouldn't have even permitted it at all, but it's true, that people's attitudes are changing and that that's why, the youth have such an immense influence
big and negative for all of thee things that society permits. And I well
yes.
I, I hope that when my girl becomes a, a teenager, well that I
It'll be so soon, friend.
oh yeah, I know, it goes by so fast.
Time flies.
I remember when I was a baby and now she's causing trouble and running around all over and learning all sorts of new things and is curious and questioning
Hi, my name is Marisa from Philadelphia
Hi, Marisa, this is Carolina, from here, Los Angeles.
Hi, good evening.
Oh, we-, well, it's good afternoon over here.
Whoa, it's true, it's three hours less there, yes.
Well, i was thinking, dear mother, ¿how can it be?, hey, we got a very difficult subject today
Very difficult, indeed.
Oh, dear mother, because i am from Venezuela.
Ahem...
¿Where are you from?
I am from Spain.
Oh, okay.
Well...
And, and you know that we're living a critical moment right now, specifically with the United States and the, our new president.
Yes.
And then, oh dear mother...
Yeah well, and, well something similar is happening to me too, and what i can say about the United States is not very positive either because, because... I'm not left-wing either, anyways, then well...
Wow,
About the, the thing about the United States really is, that...
It's hard, it's
she is very happ-
strong, and even, I don't know if you by any chance have, umm, knowledge of a page that's called eh, TV for all
and there you can see the television channels from
No
all the countries in the world including, of course, Spain.
Ah, yes.
Aha, it's called like this, T V pu- eh, T eh, T V a four
T V for all Oh
aha, a four and all A L L like television for all, something like that
Oh.
eh, there you can watch, well, and we coincidentally eh, we've been watching, eh a private channel from Venezuela
Mhm.
and, it's, of course, a state channel, but but now really from the state not like before it was of the state, but as if it wasn't
Mhm.
and then now we can eh, really see the truth, what is going on, eh, what was never said and specially with our president who is a person really
as we say it in Venezuela, bright
Mhm.
eh, I don't know if you've had a chance to hear him on some occasion.
Well I think that yes, yes, on television and of-, after what ah mm ah mm. The Summit of the Americas and everything that's happening there.
Exactly, exactly, the-
yes, yes. They show it here, in, in Philadelphia a ch-, there are several of the usual Hispanic channels like Telemundo, Univision
Aha, same here.
Galavision and all that.
Same here.
And you hear everything, yes, and
But you know that those people, regrettably, well no, I mean, they show whatever suits them, me-
It's not like, and here too, here everything is controlled by the government, I mean, let's say
Exactly, exactly.
eh, we only hear what no-, what they want us to hear.
Right. Right, and they show, even, well, sometimes, they twist the facts
Mhm.
They twist the facts about what's happening and then I always find po- with people that, for example, tell me good heavens! and what do you think about the mad man that you have for president? and
I go oh! my mother, they touch my sensitive spot. Well, the truth is that I completely agree with that mad man, ah, well what I was
wanted to tell you was that, after they've said a bunch of outrageous stuff, no?
Mm.
and I go, oh my God, give me patience lord, because it's a supremely delicate subject
yes.
I have even had a, several problems here eh, with even with, with Venezuelans
Mm.
eh, people that have been here many years and that don't know what is really happening in Venezuela
yes
and besides that, they're afraid of the idea they've been sold, communism and I don't know what about Fidel, and this and that
well, I really don't know, how, how much you know but uh, for example, the situation we're living in Venezuela is a very special situation
Hmm
very specific of Venezuela, I mean it doesn't have anything to do with the Cuban reality, with what happened in Cuba, like, they
they had to adopt that system, eh, what were the needs that made them adopt that system, and and what happened during the time they
hmm, they were applying that, because, evidently, there were mistakes, as they are in everything, as we have mistakes now too
Sure. yes
We've been making mistakes, however, well, we're working on that, as the president says, well, clearly he has a report against
the government, not against the country but against the government here, who are the
Sure
they assume a policy as they see fit, as they see fit, arbitrarily
yes, I mean, they've become, as the question says, the world's police, they think they are
Exactly
the bosses of everything, and they tell you what's going to happen, and if you don't agree, then they do it the hard way, you, you have to agree
Exactly, right, I mean, and if you don't, then I'll blackmail you
Hmm, exactly
Aha, then wow, eh
With an embargo, with, with anything, or even harder, with violence, ay, with war
Exactly. Exactly, it's a very
Um
Due the things I've seen i think that America is somehow awakening
mhm
That there are more people noticing what is happening, because, it is like they were inside a bubble
It is still a long way, and that is what makes me more
yes
It makes me angry because it is clear, if you know two plus two equals four, and you see how people have been manipulated
right
When you try to say something to the other person, look things are like this, don't you see? Then they say no, because you are
liberal or communist, it's like they
right
you put labels on yourself
um,  bad labels
bad, bad lables, if you are not a terrorist or are anti--anti--, go away we do not want you here, if you do not like
right
and I say, but if, um, this isn't a bad Country, are it's leaders
Right, that what they say to me sometimes, What are you doing here?
yes
I say, look, if I could be in Venezuela and not to be with the president, like, the fact that you are in a
Country or no, like if you left your country that doesn't mean you have a political position
Uh um.
No one knows the reason why people is here
Right
In, uh, at any given time, but that has nothing to do with the opposition, because, for example, ¿how many Venezuelan people don't live in Venezuela?, and what they're doing it's bashing
the people and the Venezuelan government
Um
I mean, that you don't have to be here or there to be supportive or to not be supportive, i mean, that position is very, uh, i, when they tell me that, i laugh a lot
Yeah
Because, ¿why are you here?, and well, maybe you would do the same, thank god that you're here, not in Venezuela.
No, but the, it's also the same in Spain, the thing it's that it's diff-, it's different, the left wing government, but even if it was right-wing, that's a, a different mindset, because the
people, when they don't agree, they go to the streets and, and they do protests, and you never see that around here, i have never seen that.
Right, right, no. Look, the whole problem is the gas, that's been really... but look
Oh, um.
outstandingly high, that people cannot, uh, they don't protest, i say, oh my god, but ¿what's wrong with these people?, i mean
you're supposed to, you react when it's affecting your pocket, but it seems like it isn't, i don't know what's going on, or, or they change cars and buy more economic one, i don't know.
Yeah
i don't know what's going on, but they don't have, i mean, generally they don't have the need to protest about some things
Yeah
How ever, i tell you, i don't know, suddenly here; ¿are you in, in Pennsylvania you told me?
Yeah, in Philadelphia, yes.
In Philadelphia. I don't know, but here I have felt that there is more, it's like the people are just waking up.
Mm.
I feel like they are rejecting of the, the actual president, and and like they are seeing that the things are not being painted to him because
Me too, me at first that there wasn't I didn't have access to that, that website I said, My god, is it true about they are saying about venezuela? but I talked with my friends
And they said, no girl , what is that? Look, jeez seriously, but look the power of TV is
yes
very big, well talking precisely about the subject, the power
The power, yes
and the TV is powerful
yes, they are the ones who control it, I mean, here
Of Course.
eh, Philadelphia is a democrat city, everybody in the world are democrats, but the rest of the state is republican and of people of, gringa, of the town that say those things
I don't know, very very ra, very radicals.
Correct.
very religious, very closed minded, o yeah, so
yes, yes, yes, yes
No, can't, he won't change, so while it doesn't change, well
Of course, of course, and what are you doing there in Philadelphia?
Me, well with my husband here mm we moved here in, one year ago, we used to live in Florida and ah
Okay.
Here searching for a job, we just moved
Oh, and you think is better than Miami?
We are in the process, well I liked most, what happens is that the question of work is better here in the north, the south is heavily congested.
Okay. Okay.
And wath we shall do? Job is first.
Of course, of course, and we went here. How are you?
He works in the pharmaceutical industry, doing clinical research
Okay. Okay.
And I, working as administrative, and volunteering
Okay. Everything that appears, of course
What I found. Of course.
But, how long you're in the United States?
Twelve years.
Twelve?
Mhm.
Oh, my god. I been here for six years, and I want to go back if God allows us.
When I arrive, Bill Clinton was the president, and the country was in a incredible stage of works, everybody was happy, the economy was going up
Yes, of course.
Then arribe the republicans with Bush, and everithing went down, as you say.
Yes sir, yes sir, and ...
This can be little by little, is this I don't know, the world, Spain is already
Yes.
When I'm going to Spain, all in the world, to the, to my husband, that is american, he looks bad and says to me, and he has a lot resentment, because he says, look your country
is broken the world, is seizing of all and
Oh! My God.
believe that, that yes, that believe that are the you know, the owners of all, and
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
and is resentment of power
yes, and look that I also fell before a little in that, and now I understand that is not like that, is like us, because we don't have
guilt of our, what our government does.
Sure.
Then, before I also see to Americans like the gringos, now I understand that no, they are americans that are from USA, because that is another wrong concept that is handles ¿isn't? then,
Ajá
well, we also are americans, if the case we go
Sure.
And, then when after that it starts to reflect a little and, no, no, they aren't americas, is the government policy, that well, what they do is
they decide, do, then, sure, is reflecting against the people against the country
Mhm.
but it doesn't like that, is the state is te policy of the government
yes, I don't like it, I am, I am Spanish and I am american, I here is the need, and is like the taste but to me is
Sue.
eh,and must stand and must endure all that the government is doing, but I don't even know, I don't like it, it is a
Sure, sure, yes, no and you have, precisely one have the right, because of being in a democracy we have the right to protest.
Sure.Fine, but in practical field, don't even say a thing, unless
I, ah, exactly, exactly, no I, I wish that this, is is
Mm. Is like a regime, yes.
It doesn't affect the linguistic project in any way, but is fine, at least it is a very controversial subject, when I heard of it
Very
that subject, I was dying, and saying
Me
why? Why?
I must say, I will speak about Bush, because I am so so angry, I must speak to Bush and I put him in a bad spot because
But that's fine, thank God, you are not alone. I've heard what people say, they don't speak but they rant about him and I say
yes, yes, yes.
truly, finally the people are finding out, except that
that it is
they think that people are dumb and it will not happen
Uhm
it tells of the atrocities they are doing, for God's sake.
No, atrocities and then later, and and everyone throws their hands over their heads, My God, this cannot be, I don't know why
and no, the next week they forget the issue because
Of course.
the press and  TV, well they go to another thing let's say to, to, to distract, something to distract, then people forget.
Of course, look.  yes, and you know that a little bit ago, here the film festival ended and Latin American
Mm.
and of course, they showed a movie, eh this Argentinean, but the directors were Spaniards.
Mm.
and then, very interesting, because you know that Spanish cinema also has many movies, this of protest, a move of
yes.
kind of documentary, this where
Mm.
Well my name is Ibet, with whom do I have the pleasure?
Mercedes is speaking.
Hello Mercedes,how are you? Where are you from Mercedes?
From Honduras.
Oh from Honduras?
Mhm.
Wow I have a sister in law that she is from Honduras.
Ah. from where?
Ay no, don't Eh know, but I know that she is also Honduran.
Ah, that is good.
yes, is
And you where are you from?
I am from Mexico.
Ah. from where ? The City eh,Capitol
From the city yes,Mexico City.yes and
What do you think of today's topic? That it is easier to break up with someone young or do age make a difference.
Mn,look well. I already went thru that phase and I am now married. but for example ah mm.well don't know.The experience that I had was very difficult.
I feel that is difficult when you really love the person when you don't really love is like any other thing,okay fine,is over okay.
Each one their own way.
Yeah.
And so, I believe that when you really care about a person in that case I imagine that it is because you do not get along well with that person
o o because really I don't know maybe it is because they tried to get along between the two people and I think that it is that more than nothing
a communication between relations
Mhm
well in between relations. And yes there isn't one, one of the two parts begins to lose the descon- there will be a lose of trust and begins
to deteriorate the communication and so I believe that that can cause a tear but yes I think that hurts
And was there a time when you had a break up that was difficult?
Mm. Well. In reality yes, yes, yes because for example before I got married with my husband I was with a person for example eh
like so, but it wasn't for a long time, but the first, my first boyfriend
yes
and so this
it's difficult always
I was with him a short time, it wasn't much but the first illusion that i had. I don't know and and I was there and I had said well and I said that well with that one I will get married
eh I'm going to have three children I was placing my castles in the sky and when he came and said you know what? here no. here it ends.
What?
Mm
I think that he had experience saying here it ends and so I think that for him uhmm
it wasn't as difficult as it was for me
Mhm
And so now I know that everything was for the best because after that I met my husband and it was for the best
the truth.
How great.
Therefore, I don't know.
Or you'll only know that when you have had two boyfriends.
So it is and
How great. The best. But for what? If you have trouble, you get trouble.
And what about you?
when it is not necessary
Yes, and what's happening with you?
Then, to see also, if I took so long that, eh, no way around it, but I don't believe I had any difficult experience at all. We'll see, I believe so.
I see.
I went out with a friend, ah, yes. With the first boyfriend that I had, that I went out with for two years.
I see.
Yeah, I remember that we had decided that already, I don't remember precisely why we were going to break things off.
I see.
Because of this, it took ten years.
Wow.
I took 19, 18 ago.
You are married now?
Yes.
Oh.
And, afterward we, well, we stopped seeing each other. After, that was not so difficult because we were apart, I mean, he lived on one side and I on another.
Uh huh. Uh huh.
After, with another guy whom I was with, we were also together a few months he also didn't live where I, where
Uh huh.
we were, in the university where we were and he returned to his country of origin
Uh huh
and that one was also easy by the fact that one stops seeing him and quick-, I mean, it's easy, well right
yes.
in that manner.
yes.
Uh. What else? Let's see what else. After that I didn't have any other official boyfriend until S-, more than, yes, truly the experiences that I never had in some manne- experience like I don't even know, right? Thank God.
Uh huh. No, yeah, it's just that sometimes, I don't know, well, for example. I believe that in, in my case uh, with the first person I think that I grew way too fond of him
well, it was too much
Mhm.
more than what, than what uh, he grew fond, I think, of me. And it wasn't very much time, I think they were like two or three months.
Mhm.
But, at the same time I was flying because they said, ah, this is my first boyfriend and and will probably marry him and things like that,
yes.
and in- and he, and I think that that he didn't think of it like that, he said well she, I don't know if I was his third, fourth, fifth, I don't know
But said yes, then I'n not going to marry her, I'm going to go with her and I'm going to get to know her and and up to there. In return, then I think, I was the one that built my hopes up for that
And this yes, yes it hurts, the truth.
Right.
Eh, yes, it hurts because I think that you are excited and you have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and tells you no, then now.
But I think that it must, it must hurt much more when you are already living together with the person as in marriage.
Yes.
I think that it has to be the worst experience, I think, of your life it's, yes, and I hope, I hope it never happens because we don't know, right?
Mhm.
Then I hope it never happens, even right now, I have three years of marriage and everything is working then not wonderfully, but everything is fine
Thank God.
A lot of communication and things like that.
You say that it's nothing then, everything can be perfect, it's, right, always, and also
Yes.
Because there are people that make mistakes there are people that think that, ay, that the marriage is the, eh, it's according to the time of ah, and all tranquility
No.
But and one lives with the people day and night and sees it the ge-, that is
Yes.
It's impossible then that they maintain a right? A situation that way of that ay,
No, yes.
Yes, one always loves the person but it's impossible that it's only is peace, then that is what I'm saying, right?
yes
Because one, well I, I am one, a human and one has to, things that very bother other people. You know? And
yes
see, to any other persons, well I'm not saying the person that one is with in particular, but any other person, well, I know that
eventually, well, we have a saying, it is not the money of the world, all day, 24 hours day, for the rest of your life, well
That's the way it is
yes
yes, the truth , I think that it is something of the truth, it is very difficult to maintain the appearance  that everything is (happy) fine, you know? but
yes
and I think also that and I also think that, um, when you have your relationship you can know and as such when you start know the person
that, really, you won't know her very depths, you know? until you are married to that person but that but that I think that I think that
if you see that in reality you don't get along with that person, and for example, I have known people who have hit their girlfriends when they were boyfriend/girlfriend, he would hit and treat them poorly and would obligate them to do what he wanted later.
I think those relationships, well they will never go anywhere good, because if they haven't gotten married yet
and to try
and they already treat them like, imagine how it will be when they are married, no but a little bit later, they will say, you are my owner and in that way
yes, yes
and how they treat you, I think, that those relationships, um, I think that they will not work. I don't know. Or, or he changes or
or changes or that kind of relationship is over, I think that if there was a relationship like that, well I, I think that it would not hurt at all, on the contrary
one should rest if one has a boyfriend that hits you or that
mmh
you are going to rest, you will say, oh its good that we're done, i don't know, everything will be good and stuff.
everything will be great and then somebody, i don't know, has to go for example, to a different country, or a different school, i think it would hurt a little bit.
yes
because, everything was good for certain circumstances, i mean, you don't have to separate, so, i think those kind of relationships, well hurt, its a kind of relationship that,
that you get hurt, and stuff so yeah
oh, no yea, that, and what it is, its ironic i mean its just that, its usually, sometimes there are times that those relationships are very hard.
for that, for people that are living, to close to those kind of relationships.
that's right.
because its usually, the people, when osmeone is in that situation there's like low autoconfidence.
ha
and then they think that, the people think that this is, good, what I'm going to reach in the near future.
i had to wait, i just have to keep on waiting, well
yes
so then, really its not so easy, one thinks that oh well he did this, i would send him to hell, no
that's right
its hard, i mean, because it turns into something like, not to say addict but, that kind of situation where
the drama is, well, a lot, right? so then the people don't know how to go out and move on, right? that happens.
that's right, your right, because
yes but
for example, i ones in the state of Mexico met a girl that um, that came with black glasses to work.
Uh um.
And i told he, ¿what's with the glasses?, it was, well the day was cloudy, ¿right?, and she had a bruise because her boyfriend hit her.
Oh
And i told her, you know, i told her, i think you shouldn't let, i don't know, i told her, but i think you shouldn't let your - touch you
your boyfriend, because; and she said: "well, it's just that, it very, it's very hard to me to break up with him". And told her: "¿Why?", and she said
"in spite of everything, i love him"
Uh um.
And then, wow, i told her, ¿What?, ¿How can you possible love someone that hits you, that hurts you?; sometimes she came, uh, bruised, or sometimes
Uh
That he slapped her or stuff like that.
Oh no.
Then, like you said, sometimes those kind of relationships are the toughest. And when she finally did it, i remember she was the one that cried, and cried, and cried every
every time she could, she cried during breaks and stuff like that, because she missed him and all that. So, i think so, in a way, sometimes, uh,
some relationship, i think that, well, i imagine it was very painful to her.
Carolina.
Fabiola
How is it going, Fabiola? How are you? Mm.
Well.  And you?
Well, well.  Where are you?
In Washington? yes.
Ay my mother.  Very far.
And you?
I am in Los Angeles.
Uf.
yes
Extremes.
We are in the extremes exactly.  how great.  And where are you from?
Chilean
Where from
Eh, Chilean, from Chillán.
Oh, Chilean.  OK, I am from Venezuela
From Maracaibo?
No, you know, know.  Why, do you know people from there?
Yes, I know a few people from Maracaibo.
Oh, yeah, yeah, Well, you know that they have a very strong accent No? Something like, look and you. MN.
Eh, yes, yes.
Aha.
look and you Are you arepa?
Ah yes, yes, yes. Good, good.Because, sometimes is so difficult to find Venezuelan people, and they say, no, no, we really know few Venezuelans, this and that, and I say Oh my G-d
We are few over here, really. But, in a.., about ten years maybe, I think that they have increased.
Yes
Mhm.
Heck, a Venezuelan girl, and in Houston.
Mhm Oh Do you work at the Hilton?
No, no, no, no, not in Houston, in...
Ah, I heard you say in the Hilton. Oh my G-d. Oh, Okay, Okay.
...Texas. No, no, I work at home. My home.
Okay, okay, perfect.
Do you work?
yes, I work with deaf children.
oh
Aha, well Now, really I am working with the parents of  deaf children. Mhm.
what a good job
Listen, yes Very hard.
Si, but, eh, it's gives you satisfaction
Yes
to help people
Exactly, Exactly. And,
There i learned
Ah, ok, ok. Chilean, of course. no?
I learned, Yes, yes
Mhm
But, by signals
Mhm, correct. But, here, is oral
Oh, My daughter taught me the alphabet here, some words
OK
Not all,
Mhm
Yes, little words
Mm, OK
But, cute
Yes, Yes, Yes. Now im, is in the oral part. No? I'm in the other side of, of, Mm, of the, mm
of the profession. Because this is, here is encouraged children to talk
and? talk?
Mmh.
Without listening, but, that they talk, that they do-
yes, no, yes.  Because they, mm, with hearing aids, can hear.
Ah.
Then, what it is done, it is that they train their hearing so they can recognize sounds.
how great.
Mmh, mmh, yes, yes.  That is like a, a possibility they have, well, of being able to speak clearly.  They will never speak perfectly, the, you, you are going to feel the difference when talking.
But, definitively they are going to have that option, well.  That even in, eh, it is/ there are some parents who combine, sign language with the oral part.  No?  Depending on,
the degree of hearing loss in, in, in the child.  If it is too deep, where there are no chances but not even with the best surgery, then, there
eh, they use sign language as a complement.
what a big job for the parents.
Mmh.  It is a huge job, truly.  It is very, very hard.  But it is very, eh, rewarding.  Because, in the end, eh, and it has its, its reward, well.  Of course, they have to really put on, as we say, put on the charger.
Because, otherwise, mm, well, hardly, well, is he going to achieve it, well
and what do you think about, about the subject they gave us today about-?
Well, you see, it is a current topic.  Current, current, truly.  I think that couple relationships are not simple at all.   You have to deal with a person who,
who is different from you, who comes from another world, another culture, another way of being, and, Then, try to have just one project, like,
eh, sometimes it is a little difficult.  No? But, I think that love is the only thing that makes it possible to overcome barriers, nothing else.
Only if there is, if there is love and lots of will from, from the couple for these, these differences and those, mm those, eh, fights that they might have in a given moment,
they can overcome, what do you think?
yes.  Of course. I think that sometime more than love and all that.  Because, love, in any case,
Um.
You acquire it through time.
Right
And, and with, with enthusiasm. So, i believe that you want to maintain a family, you have to want to maintain a family because there's a lot of people who loves you.
Um
And, they're so young, that the first thing that they can think of when they have a chance is fight, split.
Right
They don't work hard, and they love each other, they love each other maybe even more than a couple that's been married for thirty years
Sure
But, they fight every day and overcome trouble, they get over their problems.
Right.
And, i think that's what's needed, um, people these days, they should be patient and
Yeah
Think that if they choose to stay with that partner, or marry that partner
Right
Well, that's forever. Even if there's trouble, not run out at the first problem you found.
Of course. Well, look, i, with my husband, we have, we've been married for almost 8 years now.
And, me twelve.
And, twelve, imagine that. And, and we really have had, well, two critical moments, almost splitting. And, and, there was a point where also maturity plays an important role there, ¿right?
Yes
I, in another moment of my life, I had gone
Me too.
Aha.
It would mean nothing, but,
It would mean nothing, nothing. Look, it would have mattered a damn.
ah, that is what I say, if I fall, I stand up again. What is the problem?
Exactly.
But now I think about it three times.
Of course. Then, now I really think about it and say to myself, but he has another qualities. Then, I focus myself in his good things, I say, he is different from me, he cannot think as me, and I don´t have to get mad if he does not think like me.
But, do not want to let that to affect me
Ah, of course. I do the same.
Right? whatever, exactly. Then, fortunately, well, eh, the first time it was horrible, because I thought it was the end of the world. And, then we were for a long time without talking to each other until a day, I say, well, What is going on?
we have, we had almost three weeks. we had never last three weeks without talking or seeing each other. And, sleeping in the same bed.
Oh, my god.
Hm, horrible, horrible, horrible. I told him, look, You know what? it looks to me,
I have not gone through that. I have never reach that level.
hear me, not, terrible, a big tantrum on our part, really. I told him Do you know? this looks to me like a big tantrum on our part.
We don´t have, whatever, this doesn´t make sense. If you want to continue with this project, we will continue. If you don´t want to continue, we will not continue it. I love you.
I want you. But, we cannot continue like this, because you go by one side and I go to the other one. Is true, believe that I love you. And because I love you,
is that I need to define this.Because is foolish of us to live like this. Besides a place like this is not blessed by God. So,
Let's get going. Because, putting aside how serious the situation might be, it - fortnately it wasn't too serious, but, uh, seeing as neither of them wanted to twist anyone's arm, right?
It was pride.
It was foolist pride. Because that
Yeah, and it was pointless.
Not at all. Quite the opposite
it only affects
Exactly. So, good, fortunately we can pick up where we left off. And then, we had another and, neverhteless, it was less. I think the first one was really what marked us.
And it was good, well, what's more, I was just about to, as we say here, I was just about to hit the sweet spot. I said, nothing, until I got here.
"sweet spot" is like being ready to throw in the towel.
Yes. ready to throw in the towel. I said, nothing, no, no, no, I'm not going to - I'm not going to let you do it, I said. I'm not going to let you, that is, you're wrong.
If I've learned anythink in life, it is to look for solutions when we can.
Right.
Because - what are we going to do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre rlationship. As you yourself say, there are people who spent up to 30 years together, and that's a nasty relationship.
Really?
It's that they treat each other badly. This, look here, this piece of whatchamacallit, what - what is that? What do I want that for?
Ummm. No, it's - a girl, and sometimes they treat each other well, but they don't love each other.
Exactly, that too.
They're, they spend their whole life together.
Yes, yes, yes. Look, it's that so many things are happening, really. So many thinks happen with couples that it's, it's a really interesting topic. Because, you say,
There really are people that look, that seem to have everything going so well, but they don't love each together. It's like, well, I've become used to living with him.
No? There is respect. and,
Exactly
And what they wanted to form was a family.
Exactly, there are some that don't want. there are some that do wherever they want to keep an image.
No? There are some that mention love. If there is no love there is nothing.
There is nothing. In fact, there has to be love. A great love. I feel that my writing was posible because of  the love.
In fact, Everything has to have love to get us out of the difficult situations.
It makes no sense to continue something without love. I feel that way. There needs to be more love and less of that compromise you talked about.
To be there because you want and you know it's worth it.
because of course no one tells you to do it. You want to be there. You have to keep on going.
Exactly, exactly.
you could have a partner,its dificult. And when you have each other. you have to..
Exactly.
the most dificult, is to keep it with you.
That is easier. Yes Sir. You look for ways to have armony with your partner. Do different things, don´t fall in the daily rutin.
hey,
but, no. When time comes you would know it but the most important thing is to learn how to get out of the daily rutin.
Of course, Exactly. To recognize it.
And the system leads you to that.
Of course. Is your husband from Chile too?
No, he is from here.
Wow, I imagine. Like, hey, it's a little more. I mean, not that it is more difficult. Actually, I feel that love can do everything.
It's so easy, I say.
You think it's easier?
Well, for certain things, it's easier.
Oh, okay, okay. Because my husband is from Venezuela, and,
For certain.
and sometimes, I say, I think that this has nothing to do with the, with nationality. I think these are universal things.
yes, I think it's easier for me because sometimes, the, the are very fun because I do not understand what he says and says it played, then it goes well, did not have a point to fight
much with it, because it makes me laugh.
And, that, that's what I said?
what did you say? Or when we are super b-
Bad.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, hello, how are you?
Fine, I'm Viola from Idaho.
Oh from Idaho very good. I'm Alicia from Atlanta.
From Atlanta.
yes.
Oh, how are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine, Fine.
that's good, where are you from originally?
From Chile.
really? Me too.
Really?
yes.
Oh, how nice.
how funny.
How long have you been living here?
yes.  Well more or less in the for example I am there the whole two thousand three.
oh, okay
and what is it called, and of course then would come and go but more less the ninety-one, yes.  And you?
I have been living here since the two thousand two.
Oh, it is not so much, not at all, not at all
no not that long, just a little
And from Santiago most probably
yes, from Santiago
Sure
And and you, where are you from?
am, I used to live
From Santiago as well?
Sure, over there in Santiago I lived in the and in Concepcion.
Oh, okay
Sure,
Look that.  how small is the world
yes, precisely.  It sounds good.
And have you been here long in this thing?  Of calling over the phone?
Because no, I don't know what for.  I wrote myself on Monday to make
oh really?
and I didn't hear anything until
Hello?
I mean hello, yes
Ah, okay
Ay, I wish it wasn't, but this phone works badly sometimes
Oh, okay
I was saying that I've been taking calls, I don't know
Ah, you're uh, you're calling every day?
Well, I started once, and they called me four times but I was only able to take one call
Oh, okay
yes
yes, yes, they called me this week too, but I couldn't answer them, because
Okay
week is been kind of lousy
Yes, yes, and what can we do if that happens?
yes
I say, it's been
yes
fun they give a subject, maybe it's for
to talk, to have something to talk about
No, uh, yeah, that must be it
Yes, i think so.
I thought, i thought that it was like this, this study, to do, ¿what's it called?, telephone menu's and stuff like that.
Uh
well, for hospitals and theaters and stuff like that, and so they wanted people to talk about stuff about health and something like that. For example
No, what's going on is that i was told they give subjects because that why you're not supposed to speak about personal stuff.
Oh, ¿because you shouldn't or because you don't want to?
Because you shouldn't, like very personal stuff.
Oh
Because you never know about the other person on the phone, because
Oh, right, oh, yeah
So, that's why they give subjects to talk about.
Oh, yeah, i thought it was a part of the study, that they wanted to listen to words in spanish, or in castilian, i don't know.
Oh, OK
No, but no
Yeah, the only thing they told me is that you had to talk about subjects, like subjects without importance, but
Yeah, with
to have like a subject, don't just talk like fish-heads
Right, like a fruitcake
Yeah, well
yes.
Right. and do you like it here?
no, no it's that well Idaho, right.
Eh.
yes I was in in Washington near Seattle when I had just arrived to the United States, sure.
Eh,
and that, now I'm in Georgia, I'm in the South, then, in, well, like where the the all are very here and I don't know, the band and I'm in Atlanta and
go on and more it's placed here
Eh.
eh, but Idaho for example is a very rural state, like that, no.
yes, it's like a filed and everything is very very much like a field,
yes, I can imagine the same, no, it depends.
yes, it's like half and half, it's like I don't know it's like night life, I don't know,
Ah, yes, I can imagine. Oh, the thing is that I'm in Atlanta and it's a pretty big city. Supposedly should be fantastic for us, you see
two three years
Eh.
Uh, well something and all the businesses and all the bars and all the clubs must close at two in the morning, go figure.
Hello, at two.
at two in the morning, everything closed.
Oh, and why?
Well, the reason is that, the sector in Atlanta is called Bucks Head
eh.
and since, over two or three years ago, there used to be lots of crime and things like that and three people were murdered. Three people were murdered.
Oh.
So, the city had a new major and, what do I know! So, yes, people are killing
Oh.
but it's like, it's like, a city like this one has to have a
yes, okay. But, do you have to drive your car a lot or do you use public transportation?
Ah, you use your car a lot, a lot, yes.
We, ah it's the same around here, you can't go out at two in the morning, it's not
well, it's because
if you have a car or something
sure. It's bad because, for example, I would rather have a good system, for the simple fact that it's
expensive and because
yes.
there's a lot of traffic.
Oh, okay
so, the traffic sucks and I mean, you can't get to places on time
yes.
yes, the car.
It's completely different here
Oh yeah, like over there
Well, there are lots of cars, people have cars because it's necessary, something like that
Of course
Becuase there is no collective, but
Oh
They don't take too long, like to to go somewhere, where the city, where I live is like the midle of port Santiago and there's a lot less people
Yeah well.
Cause you know, here the houses are bigger, they're separated things like that.
Of course of course
And I'm not in Idaho falls
Oh yeah yeah
In Idaho falls
Yeah
And, I'm going to a bigger city
mm
There in a bigger city
Of course
Where we are, isn't all land
Oh that's good, it's the same as Claro, and they gave him something there be wise of the university of Washington.
Ah.
we were Latino. And
Here there's plenty just like there are machines like that yes.
Oh prepared and ready to go.
There is tons of Mexican and of course it's a rural area
Mm.
They hire a bunch of Mexicans like that to do the work at
Ah
the land and things like that.
Oh, of course.
Well almost always what you see are Mexicans. Me included, people see and think you're Mexican also.
Of course, yeah yeah.
except Latin, they say ah Mexican.
Of course, the grain.
Well, you have to go about saying, no no no
No.
I'm not Mexican.
Yeah. Well it's like what I enjoy is that tons of people they think that I from Palestine or somewhere tropical, yeah. If I walk into some restaurants
yes.
like if it's a Middle Eastern place and they say to me
Eh.
and they treat me to speak in Arabic, I don't know. They found me the face most of the Indian or something loke that but sure, ¿and there are discrimitation or not?
Uh uh, yes, is the same but no.
oh but
I mean yes, like everywhere
ah, sure.
Is the same, is most with the people that is Latin but they don't know speak a lot but
ah sure.
because are a lot of people for equal that going to buy and don't know anything of
And sure, sure
English so, then they have to walk to the people, you know like in everywhere, are mediums
yes yes. Sure.
because there are good discriminatory, you know that
Well, here is like good today that Atlanta and all the south is like 70% black, so.
Oh, okay
Then is like, the fact is so much diverse so is like more acceptable  that I know but at the same time to the south is the south of the
USA has that history of been one of the places more racist of all America, in fact here.
Oh,
It was the slavery and all that, then. There is a certain minority of white people that hate to any ethnic group and have his own rars demostrations and all that stuff, but
Ah, but things like strong, yes.
of course
they fight it hard.
yeah but
not here, its nothing massive here, its just like something were scared about, but not like groups or anything like that.
of course for example in the rural parts of georgia, you would see things like in KU KLUX KLAN i don't know
oh yeah. that's true
yeah you still do
oh mm
but too see those kinds of things you have to be very far away from the city.
uh
its inside the city of atlanta, its in a more civilized place, so those things don't happen
uh
yeah, that's good luck, look at what has happened.
oh oh that's weird.
and how did you get there?
oh i married an American
oh of course, from Idaho
yeah, i married an american, that's how i got here, what about you?
well my mom married an american,
oh really?
yes, for that reason we came and we went to Seattle in ninety-one, I was about eleven years.
Mm
and my father stayed in Chile and that's why, I go, and go back like that
oh, okay
of course
Mm, okay
yeah,
okay
interesting
So then, you are single now?
One like that, We are like we live together
oh, okay
so then, of course
okay, ah look, and and, what do you call it, do you like it or not?
yes, because, or rather, I am within the city, I like it, its more city maybe, I am from a city or the country. For example, I lived in San Rafael, I don't know if you hears of it but
road from San Felipe to Los Andes which is more like rural and you can't imagine how
oh,
typical Chilenean country, and I love that
yes.
Like a village, I don't know. Or I like to be in a city, I don't know, to be more within, I don't know, there are more things to do
more i don't know, what they charge is
oh
so
oh okay
yes
its not like
but
its not a drastic change me coming over here.
yeah i imagine
because i was used to living in the city, right, and here its a city and i can find anything i want, except there's more life.
its a little bit more relaxed
of course
more relaxed, that's not good because its not a good example, there's not so much crime in the city, because its big
of course
but its kind off boring.
yeah i imagine
somewhat
same in contact, its hard aswell
over here, is the same but not so much, not so much, at least small is not so big.
Hello. Oh, Hi, Juan. Marcela.
Hi. How are you? Mi name is Juan. Marcela.
yes, how are you?
Listen, didn't we speak the other day with
I think so. You are in Texas and I am in North Carolina.
Yes, It's it's my pleasure.
yes, please to meet you.
I have not forgotten. We practiced together, no? Yes. Listen, But I am, it's time, health.
yes.
Do you have social security here? Are you covered?
Oh, I am cover on behalf through my husband
Oh, oh
And the children are covered this way, so yes we are fine.
Oh, well, imagine that that, not us.
Is a problem right?
We are not covered. Is a problem because, well something could always happen, right?
Mm. We are very healthy, but you never know.
And he yes, And just the other day, I went to an, uhm, an office in which supposedly gave a type of or rather pension for
people in the community, right?
yes.
So, they would ask me for papers like my domicile, proof of job and finally they found a pretext for denying me, for rejecting me
because they asked me to send them a document from the person that was hiring me and then that person refused to give me that paper, so
Mm.
in my case, my son has epilepsy.
Ah.
So, he needed medical attention, things that
they denied that to you, medical attention?
eh, no. No, no. They refused to inscribe me. It's true. So, I get pretty stressed about that, he got really sick once. He got quite sick.
So I had to go back to Mexico so that he would be checked by his regular doctor.
Mm.
And he sent him some medication and when I need more medicine I go buy it in Mexico
yes, but I'm sure it's cheaper there.
it's a problem because I need the prescription. A friend of mine is a doctor and he gave me some samples
yes, that helps, my God.
no? yes, he gave me some. So, yes, it's something that we think should be more flexible, right, for the community, for a certain type of community
yes. I don't think that the whole system has to fall so that they change it. I think it's going to be quite hard to fix it because there are
lots of expenses, lots, and it depends on the demand. So, if those expenses keep on increasing, going up, going up
yes. yes.
because of the demand and because people keep paying those prices, so costs go up because people ask for more and more money. And then, people need more money, it's a vicious cycle. So, how could they possibly create a more social medicine?
yes.
It is impossible because all those people are like how
yes. It should be.
Money does not stop being like a drug, you see. They are accustomed to a certain amount of money.
Uh uh.
And now, all of a sudden will not have it.
Exactly.  It's a problem, it's a cycle that works with earnings and it is stronger, right?
Yes. Of course.
So the greed is worse.
Let's stop making bombs and going to war. Look, all this money that could be used
Mm.
In the schools, or in a medical system, of socialized medicine.
Mm. Mm. Well, it would go down just a little.
Mm. Yes.
With that. Because here, I don't know what it is like where you live.  But here, if anyone has money it's the nurses and the doctors. Right?
Yes, the nurses are paid very well because there are few nurses, there are fewer.
So. Mm. And here, well like you say, you see a good car with a woman who is thirty years old, for example, no?
Mm.
And she is a nurse, and that's what happens. When you figure out for sure if they are nurses.
Yes. Tell me, twenty, thirty dollars an hour.
Yes, yes I uh uh. Well here in this case well that is what is offered. In Canada, I understand, well, they have a lot of medicine, right?
Mm.
So any resident in Canada has rights to the medical services. For the fact of being there, and there are really no major consequences on the economy.
No, but the difference is that they started right.
And is Mm. Exactly.
yes, is like in Argentina, my  parents have all the medicine paid
Uh Uh
all the medicine paid. they pay a little, no, but is very little.
yes, yes, yes. That's the other thing that one can at least, try to pay something.
yes.
will have some sort of insurance but even that is
Is, is really expensive
is expensive, no? And then I don't know how the medicines here are, in Mexico they are cheaper and is more like that
in all parts of the world. In all parts of the world.
And there's more medicine competition over there. That for the.
yes, there was a medicine I was taking, my son took for a short time and it turns out here they didn't have the medicine, you see, generic.
Uh uh
Eh, and then, we went to Argentina last year, I went to the pharmacist and I showed it to him and something that cost here more than fifty dollars
over there I bought if for twelve dollars.
yes, yes, yes.
Twelve dollars, the same brand and everything.
yes.
And could have could have been less if I bought from the other brand, the unknown brand one thing.
The same. yes.
But I don't understand.
And the case of Mexico, for example, my son's medi- cine is available in five, six brands
Mm.
with similar ingredients.
Mm.
No? yes. yes. And here there's only one. And second that in literature she's not the best. And it is hey but only the laboratories, I thought that all of the North American laboratories well uh
then at the hour of the competition well there's a monopoly here.
yes. yes. yes.
Super strong interests in everything, no?
That's really true. That's really true.
Mm.
I mean what do I know, according to whatever thing like that
But.
According to the specialty they have to operate over here. Do you know what you would have to do?
yes.
Why don't you contact an organization that is called the Shriners?
Uh uh. Oh yes.
Shriners yes.
yes, I already know, yes, I already know.
Eh, because they help kids.
Mm.
Now I don't know if they specialize in a specific disease. Or if they cover everything because perhaps
Mm.
you can get in touch with them and tell them, listen we have a son and this is his condition and this is our situation.
yes.
And maybe they can help you in some way. Because the Shriners dedicate themselves to help, to pay for the medical care of kids. that cannot pay.
Uh uh. Uh uh. Well yes look, yes
of parents that cannot pay.
yes I knew about that. Listen, is our time up or what?
I don't know, they say is twelve minutes but their twelve minutes seem more like half and hour.
Oh, Look that, yes I only knew about the and thought it was for me. And me smaller without getting tired and like that
yes. Maybe I'm wrong but finding out doesn't cost anything.
Mm. I'm going to crash.
And also if you call Catholic Charities
Uh. Uh uh. Yes that.
maybe they, maybe they have I don't know, something that can help you in a
yes, yes, is very simple because in reality, well on one side the maintenance is a medicine that this person that helped with the sample said no man this
here they give us, you have no problem. No more do you see some community center or something and
Mm.
there are a lot of signs. And, but knowing a little more about the advances. it's that I can give the medicine we think that a stronger diagnosis could improve my son's life with
with the epilepsy, no?
Of course.
because it was under control but ultimately now he has about two years that it has been uncontrolled. It has been under control.
Mm. And of course he is growing and then at best now that medicine doesn't help him, they have to give him another.
And, well He gives it to me, gives it to me yes. yes, they gave him another. They increased its effectiveness and he got sick and then Well either way, he had to stop and go back to the basics.
Mm.
yes, yes he got much worse.
what a thing.
yes, yes, then it's that now you know, it's a question of experimenting.
And you, you must live with your heart in your mouth.
Well yes, sometimes yes.
and that's a lot of stress.
Always yes.
A lot of stress.
life even though you don't say it's always unsettled, all the time.
Mm. yes, yes. yes.
no? After you know that always you are hoping that it doesn't happen. Well, I don't know what what happens really no But then that trauma but to my poor son because he's a teenager then
Mm.
It happens in school and then he feels really bad.
Of course because on top of it it's embarrassing.  Look, how old is he?
Yes, yes, it's a stigma.  It's a stigma.  What he has, no? so
How old is he?
seventeen.
Ah, of course, he's a teenager.
Per se, well getting back to the theme I believe that there should be some good ones here
Yes.  Also do you you know where you can find out? In teaching hospitals
system of, uh
From the doctors.  A the medical centers where there are schools of medicine.
Uh uh.
A lot of times the different departments
Yes.
go to people that don't, can't pay in the situation as one usually would, you see? Like we how can't go to a specialist because it costs a lot of money.
Mm.
And we don't have it.
Mm.  Yes.
And then they take them.  And then the take note of what what they give you. And they cover it accordingly.  Something that's always
reasonable.  Something that you'll well be able, uh, to do. Sometimes they don't charge anything.
Mm.
Monthly and that, it is it is this interesting.  I had to have an abscess done.  It happens that I have something called ADD
Uh uh.
and I a few years ago thought that I had it but in the end I went and since I had diagnosed myself and at the end I found here in the hospital that teaches the University of North Carolina
Uh Uh
They didn't charge me anything and they gave me all the tests.
Ah, Yea?
Yeah.
Well then everything is pretty good, at the orientation, that I went to, where justifiably it is called University System, healthcare system something like that
Ah, yes so that is with the
So justifiably that is where they kicked me out
With the university Ah?
I told him.
Ah. What a thing.
Mm. Uh uh. Therefore, they told me I needed to bring them information. I had a letter from my admissions, etc, no?
Mm.
But, that isn't, we need the social security from your employer. So that is when they just didn't want to.
They didn't want to give you that information.
No? Well I don't. But, well now I have my own social security, my own.
Ay, so you probably can
Yes, Employee.
Mm.
So anyway I'm going.
You probably can now.
Uh uh
Hello, how are you? Mi name is Juan
Hello, hi uh, Mateo
I am in San Antonio. Mateo, I think he talked already, you are in Philadelphia
yes, yes, yes, and you are
ah, look, I ma glad to talk to you again
yes, how have you been?
listen, fine everything is fine, what do you think about today's topic?
no, I did not listen to it, what is the topic?
the topic is about thecnical devices, I mean the technology, the most used devices and how much do you depend on them and how you consider the dependency.
and you consider the tecnology, no? your daily life, if it turns out to be more a problem than a solution or something like that.
does that include automobile, cars?
is the same that, is the same that I was thinking, of course, it should be included, no?
yes because is a, you know? a machine
exactly, yes, but, I said well yes, the automobile seems to be the most important, no? is then I thought maybe is the computer, but no
yes, the most obvious is the computer, but, is not the only one
aha, exactly but sometimes, eh, what seems like a more personal element depending on the case, then it can be the car, no? because the computer is now every time more just another tool
then more than, than, sometimes, lets say that it is part of the institution where you are found, no? is more like a working tool
ah
but a very personal tool seems to the car, no?
yes, and that is why, the same thing you buy a car and you are always using it and you always have to give it maintenance, you always have, is part of your life
because you have to take care of the car and you know?
yes yes,exactly also because I am here in Texas
ah
I feel that car culture here is kind of the way culture was also for horses in the days
did you use horses more?
no? it is like a horse, it is something very personal very close
yes
the life we have they take care of them here and it is as important as the horse was in that era
yes
some years ago, and well if they do not say in our era of communication the most important elecronics are the ones that have to deal with communication and computer
eh what allows communications and all that no?
yes because in Texas yes but even there in Texas
but
you all need a car you know? to work
yes
so that
exactly and here the working people have, like in those times a like a mule no? need a pick up a truck pick up
ah,yes yes
pick up truck,no? and go and give, and for it not to leave yoy, then it is you can tell like there is a culture for hard work very important
yeah
and the computers, good, well all the houses there is television, telephone and computers practically, no? but, but how are there other dimensions no? of the technological question, then the auto appears to be
of the most important
yes, but, the questions in the topic were which
ah, what what tecnological question, is technology important in your life? what is that we are discussing right now if it had to be the auto or if it had to be the computer? what you do you opine?
well, for me it would be my computer and cellphone
aha, exactly
because you know? because i have my cellphone and I am always with it
aha
and, well I have become used to having a cellphone, you know?
aha
before, I did not have a cellphone until I became twenty years old, but now that I live in Philadelphia, in the city, and that I'm not always at home for-
I'm always returning to my house for, for, you know? see my messages
yes, yes
well, I am always, I am always, I always have my cellphone
you have your cellphone
I think that it is very surprising that almost the whole world has a cellphone, here in the United States
yes, I notice that, it is very important what you just said, some time ago, when I worked I had the type of job in which the computer was the most important, no?
yes
and well, the computer had the messages, it always had internet, e-mail messaging more than the cellphone, no cellphone nothing, no?
yes
The computer was the most important
but now
but now, with the kind of work that I'm doing, the car it's the more important than the computer, because the car let's me do the work I'm doing
more physical right?, then the care becomes the most important instrument, and the computer, well, it goes to a second instance, but it is also important, right?
But it's because the kind of work
Well, for me, I think that, well, you're in Texas and obviously there are more free land and contryside, and
a lot more space
yes,yes
because in the cities, having a car can be an inconvenient thing also
yes, that's right
because you have to park it and, well, parking is expensive and you can't find any gas stations near, and, well, I don't know, is
is more a problem that a help, but obviously, you know?, obviously
oh really?
it's better to have a car I think
yes, well, here, yes, because the distance you have to drive to work, the car is essential
Of course
But also in the city, I think, and the most import..., well, according to the job, it might be the computer, right? then
the other question, the communication electronics, right?, the cellphone and
yes
and then, the other question is if you consider that this technologies are more of a problem than of
we.. what type of problems can you have, no? as you just said, with the car, the problems that have to do with parking
aha
no? here in Texas no, there is not, where I am there are not many problems, no? with parking there is a lot of space everywhere, no, it hasn't presented yet
let's say, those problems here, but in the end, I don't know, I don't know what you think, more, more than anything I would say that, well regarding cars, car issues, and ll that well you don't see a big problem unless that
we considered it like a problem interests created around, around the car industry and how they sometimes appear to affect the same development of technology of
of transportation, no? for example
aha, but, don't you think that also, it is like wonderful that that it has changed in like sixty years?
yes
ah- yes we look like seventy five years ago there were no cars, but today almost everyone has
yes yes, yes but, yes
the same thing with computers they have, they have computers that that are not going to let out in the market for, for like ten years, because
well
because they already have the- the very advanced things and the things have not they have not
yes
charged the development costs, you understand? I don't know how to explain it well but
exactly yes, but as they also say, with the car industry, no? if the car industry had advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry perhaps cars could transport us with
at one hundred kilometers with just one liter of gas
aha
no? and instead of costing twenty thousand dollars, they would be costing two thousand dollars
yes
If that's the case, no? but technology, that industry at best,  has its own interests and it's as if it doesn't advance no? you heard what they are saying about the hybrids
I say no, many are saying that they are not cost effective and that in reality is a matter of manipulating company image, when the times comes for viewing performance tables
I though hybrids cars would be more efficient I think the efficiency they have achieved is minimum
yes
no? no I don't think they have a real real, that they it is really an important change in technology given its efficency
yes, that was an important change
Pardon me?
don't you think is an important change, or
no, no I don't think it is so important at the same time the efficiency they show es radically different than that of other cars it is too little. no? you see that's what I say
ah
one,ah, according to the tables an economical car can provide you with thirty six miles per galon
yeah
and a hybrid can give you fifty
ah no, ah yes sure, sure, there are some cars there, as for example the the Fords
uhm well
the pickup, well the pick up trucks are being changed so that they become more efficient, you know.
aha
but, the Expedition and that type of huge cars, they do use lots of gas, you can only drive around twenty or eighteen miles per gallon or something like that, it's a huge amount
yes, that's right, sure, but at the same time, for example, these cars, the small cars, they have the same performance as the hybrid cars, and they are not hybrids, no?
the small cars, the new ones that are not yet in the American market, that are now in the European or Latin America's markets have to be more efficient
ah, yes
and smaller, isn't it? So, if we buy a car at the price of a hybrid car and we compare it against a small European car or to one of those cars of Latin American, well
it's a  lot more expensive to have a car because the initial cost and because you will save money on gas, then
it's cheaper that a normal car, a good economical car, right?
and, why is that?
European
why are the United States one of the only countries to have this, why do we have this huge cars, you know?
yes, it's like, yes
most of the countries have small cars, well, different, it's a different culture, you know, but
yes I do, a few years ago it had something to do with the oil, in the eighties or around that time, I don't remember
ah, aha
I thought that was going to change, that the culture was going to change because they started making smaller cars here in the United States.
yes, but
so I thought, oh well, the culture is going to change but it didn't it was like a temporal thing, because they still have lots of huge cars, they still
I am Ana Maria
Ah, Faviola, hello
Hello Faviola
How are you?
Well, and you? How is the weather our there in you home?
Very good, sunny or cold
sunny and cold, ah.
Cold
Because we are ugly, we are cold. How are the movies? Had we already spoken about this issue?
yes
I had already touched on this subject before.
I had not touched and I touched talking about, specifically the person that talked to me talked about violence
mhm
No, he liked the idea of going to see the movies I say, that the world is the world. It has violence
mhm
It has always had, and I have experience teaching children love and peace on the television, or in the world and then when they face the world which is the school area.
They are the children that do not know how to defend themselves. Especially when you have unique children.
yeah
then uh, I find that if the classification is good, they have, I think it is the responsibility of the adults where children can go to watch television.
I agree, it is the ultimate responsibility of the parents.
They are doing their job with the movies, and
and making their money, what is your job
is your business, you.
doing your business, yes
if now he wants it, you take, he want to see it, he doesn't is no longer their responsibility, they see
of, yes
that sells
yes
and it is what they do, it's not their fault, only of the one who buys
yes, that they like the product in the end, that's why
yes
with you that you are have the greatest responsibility, be violence, sex, whatever you want to protect a child for, i think the parents have the greatest responsibility, although you have a rating
because if you have a movie rating for example ~PG thirteen
yes
And you have e minor child of that age to see it, it's your responsibility
yes
Is because you let him and thought that is okay. Isn't that right ?
Exactly
The why, the association, or, whatever he puts, eh, you have the rating and he already has it, then,
I think yes, look that we think almost the same on that Faviola because, in the end the responsibility of raising and caring and what you want him to see or not
Your children, or your family. Eh, you like a mother or your husband like a mother.
mm I think as well that I am completely in agreement and the other, normally the children have access to television when the parents are outside.
Exactly
The children are alone
mhm
And there the father isn't there to teach them or say to them this you shouldn't watch, yes you should see
Or if they go to a sleepover you don't know also
Of course you don't have a clue
If they go to a sleepover and they put a movie on, they watch the movie or they don't have control in that house or whatever it is
You also don't know
Exactly.
I think what's important is given the kids a, that they respect that, signs if one gives them good principles in the house. One as a family teaches them those things,
Of course
Really I don't like that, or because I don't like it. That you see it, or that you are not prepared, or that the moment will come
That, because like they say you can't keep them in a crystal box
No and also
goes exposed or exposed
Yes also and when the kids get to a certain age. My son had fifteen years, sixteen sixteen years and he would say don't worry because you did the best that you could
mhm
ah, it is the twenty five percent of the genes and the education and the rest is decision my decision of my life
Look, with that
Of course, then I learned.  Oh wait, no eh, oh, I was and
mm
My cell phone was ringing.  OK OK leave that and I answer.
OK
eh, don't hang up because we have to talk twelve minutes.
yes
I just went to pay it
OK ah
And about people I believe that I love movies, watching horror movies.
OK
But there are times when, when they scare me and I'm an adult.
You, you scare yourself,
they make me scared and I'm going to find out about horror movies.
OK OK.  But your responsibility is to see it, and you scare yourself.
yes
OK well I don't like them and I don't watch them I don't watch any kind of those.  That's also my decision, even being old enough to see them, if it is too violent, I don't want to see it.
Yes.  Because of that I respect what my son told me that time, fifty per cent is responsibility,
Yes
of, of the individual, of the person, eh, you already did what you could, but there is a time when children before turning eighteen.
That some are more mature than others.
Yeah
And they start to watch the R movies.
Um
at fourteen and fifteen years, and eleven, twelve year old children are watching the PG thirteen.
Yeah, yes.
And sometimes even little ones. Sometimes even younger, because i remember Jenny's friend, that watched Harry Potter, and it's
Yeah, thirteen, right.
PG thirteen, PG fourteen, and then i say, Jenny doesn't like it, it scares her.
Right
She's cared of monsters and all that.
Yeah
But, yeah, i agree that for the most part, in the end it's about the criteria you make for her. Take care of them if you don't want them to watch TV when they're alone.
Yeah, 'cause, because
Not leaving them alone with the TV
But imagine that you still can't control them.
But it's just TV, no more you.
That's why I'm telling you, you can control them, "you can't watch this movie because this and this reason, because you're not mature enough" or whatever you want to tell them, ¿right?
And you have to have some judgment to watch some movies.
Yeah, that's why I'm telling you, you get nothing from telling her, "you can't watch that", so, because there will be a time when she'll go to a house, how can i say, her friend's house.
aha, in the same school they show movies.
Oh the same school, but the same school is a bit more supervised because that is already a different thing. Because because it goes, it goes with an end.
They show documentaries.
but I'm more afraid when he goes to friends' houses. And sometimes they have the television in the piece, the most that it is used, or the computer or whatever it is.
And they have access to information without the parents. No, the parents have no idea. And they are in the piece believe the parents believe that they are listening to music or whatever it is
Maybe they are looking at something inadequate. But that's what I say, whatever happens, it's that my son and my daughter or whatever it is,
are faced with that situation. He has to learn to value himself, and learn to respond to that, that's what they said, or rather trying, trying to give them the values of the house.
Continue like, like superman the little boy that climbed on the window and killed himself.
It, of course, because you know that they are not yet prepared.
that I wanted to fly. No, I, I want to ask you a question.
aha
eh, did you read the rules to the game on the telephone?
yes Okay
I was asking myself, ah, how is this? are you already preparing for Christmas?
yes, yes, I am preparing myself I am already buying my family's presents. But at the moment I am with everything, with other things on my mind.
you're on a birthday no.
yes but, but I am already preparing, buying presents for the family at least for my nephews. I already have them ready, we have already bought them presents, then the big people remain no less.
Buy the bigger people something, an attention, either way I am making the majority of the presents.
That's what I was going to tell you
I am going to cook. yes ah
Cook and saw. Saw that you did, that you gave to me.
yes, also for some kids, yes, too
No that, the table thing
yes, the, the yes too, but i have no time, i still have to wait until mid, until the last week of December to do it.
Oh, because they're
because i have no time before.
That's pretty.
Yes, and that's what I'm doing too. That's why i'm doing some gifts , but for example. am, the Andreita, for example it's her birthday soon.
Two days before Miranda.
It's Andreita's birthday, too. Oh, three
yes, she's from twenty five or twenty four, i don't remember.
Oh, ok, yes, but i remember that it was like three days.
Three days then from twenty four. Then, i have her little gift, i bought her the same i bought for Miranda. So, uh
¿And what what did you buy to Miranda?
For the re- a screen of those that draw and erase.
Oh, that's so nice.
Because she likes it, right, she already met them and she likes them, she draws little lines and then she erases them, and she has- the i am not going to give them to them yet because they're very little and she would put them in her mouth.
But in the mean time, the pencil and the screen yes.
Aw, that's very nice.
But yes, because things like that.
It's so exciting
Right, so, you see. Things like that are a joy to do, so i bought the same for little Andrea. And that's it
And, do you know who else's birthday is today
No, ¿who?
The same day
¿Who?
That i remember, when i was there
My father in law, that
Your father in law, yeah
Yeah, that's true, ¿who?
Him, Juan Luis, Sandra's youngest son
Oh, yeah, right.
Also on, on the twenty nine. I remember that also around the same date, i remember that they're all around the same date.
I don't remember that he was at, at least i didn't know.
No, you went to Carlitos's birthday, and the little girl's
I haven't been to any birthdays on Sandra's house, i went to one, but i honestly don't remember.
No, you were there, you went to Chile once and you left her the gift for his birthday
Oh, well, that was on April, it was April when i went to Chile
Ok, that was another birthday, because she's three
I leave the presente there
yes, for her nephew who came after
Of course he came, he told me after i gave it to him, but he didn't say his name
Sandra will not organise her birthday, she will not make a party this year
no, no, OK
I didn't say no, i mean just for the family, because they are going to buy something better for the kid
yes, that's true
That's because she does a very big parties
yes very, yes
She spend a lot of money in that and now she can't afford it to the kid
what they really want, exactly
they have to decide between one or another thing, this year the kid decided to be with the family
to have a special gift
Sure, to have one more present
Juan Luis is the oldest or the youngest
The smallest kid of all
oh, yes
and he said he doesn't want any clothes
Poor kid
I don't want books i just want toys
Carolina
Tamara
Tamara, how are you?
yea, and you?
good good, where are you?
Im in washington, seattle
wow I'm in los angeles.
oh yeah
yeah, its incredible, its great
yeah
I was making a call and then i realized that it was sunday, i fell asleep for half an hour more than usual, i was like oh my god!
yeah, yeah you got me out of base, but do you have time participating in this?
yeah this is it, i think this is my twenty third call
wow you're almost ready, I'm halfway there, im on the tenth part.
yeah, and this is the second time i take their services.
oh okay okay, yeah because i casually received a letter that they are taking intakes so they can participate again, because at first you could have only participated once.
yeah
Did you get the same email? right?It will apparently continue, that's what i understood in the email i received.
yes i know
That's good, tell me
So what you think of about what they put in the movies?
Well I'll tell you honestly, it's been more than a year since we stopped watching movies on regular film.
little "conventional"
aha
We had a movie, for example in the case of film, it's the same as with the television. Now we see this documentary-style films ... Eh, with other messages then.
aha
Watch movies that are in uh, what do you call this?, Lost festivals, here is an example the recently completed International Latin American Film Festival
hey if you were
yeah
Hello!
No, I'm not here at my computer, sorry
Ah, okay this will take about a month or so because for a very long time as I say we decided that they were going to continue wasting your time.
time, in most cases movies really are quite silly with nonsense content and it's good we made the decision because no, we did not want to lose any more time or money
Okay
Hey seeing that kind of movie didn't really bring anything.
Yes because there are enough movies, I have noticed
yes
yes I like one, for where I live close to before they had some of these new ones ah like Hollywood Video or Blockbuster but it was like
much smaller
Okay
they had some movies, they were kind of documentaries and like that, but it was closed because of the big stores around, people don't want to go to those places
Of course
but those are the best, I find movies that I like. My husband is American, but he also likes international movies, movies with more
more important things to talk about
Exactly, exactly
Sometimes, because we had little children, they want to watch movies with use, and we take them, but not usually. Time ago we went like two or three times per moth to the cinema
yes
but we have reduced that, now it's like once or twice every two months
Okay, we also went like once per month, but it was really usual, sometime we saw a really stu
pid, so dumb that i felt annoyed to be there, and well, what are we doing here?, why I'm wasting my time?
No no, and then we started to get information in other kinds of movies, and well, we moved completely to that side, right now are with
a movement like those, we are kind of intellectual, but now, we have reach a stage where you feel like
What are we doing? I mean, I prefer going to sleep that to watch those thins, but there are movies that have
a really different feeling, they are worth, but lately I think they are making movies just for doing them
yes, exactly
Yes, it's like, "Well, we have to make 10 movies, let's make them, how?, when?, it doesn't matter"
As they role as we said. Where are you from?
I'm from Panama
Oh, Okay, I'm from Venezuela
Oh, okay
Right, yes
in, then, it is true, it's true
We say like this, "a lo Macho", ¿right?, like, well, yeah make movies, whatever, but yeah there are some good and others, well, they're not but
Honestly, not. And the same is happening now with the TV. We had cable and just about a month ago we cut it because, i don't know, suddenly it was like
we were against that, we saw there was a lot of manipulation from the media, they only show you the news that they want, they hide the truth
uh, so that's the news level, and about the movies, so it's like yeah, why not, a good movie, a really good movie
but then they repeated it, and repeated it, and repated it. ¡Oh my God!, ¿What's this?, we're paying for this, so it's like a annoying, we're annoyed with
with the media we're like reluctant, yeah, yeah
Yeah, what you're saying it's true. Over here i, my husband and i, we watch the news.
I think, right
Because every time you watch something or they show you something really stupid
Exactly
Or they exaggerate it a lot
Exactly
Because, when i was, we were in Panama before Noriega got out of Panama
Oh, imagine that
And we were there, and my husband, you know, he's a white man, paper white compared to my dad, my dad is brunette and my mom is white, so i was darker than my dad, so
when we went out, you knew he was American
Yeah, obviously
And we both got, we got into where we were going, and he had to go to work into the base and i had to go with him or something like that
of course
and suddenly we would arrive home and we would watch TV, there was so much little things that happened at Panama, I would watch him
Hey weren't you and I by there this morning? I don't remember looking nothing like that there.
exactly
and the next day the same thing I say: ay what an ex-agente! I think they were teaching the thing that they showed last week and exaggerating the thing so
Exact-
it's from that moment that, he doesn't want to believe what they say on TV.
Exactly,
the news nothing like that; that is what I tell my kids do not believe everything that the TV says.
Exactly.
Because it is not true, and that
Look, casually they let me borrow a movie that was called "la... something like " La Decepcion de Panama" or "La Defencion de Panama"
right
Just when the Noriega problem and everything else we looked all the documentary I stood cold, because in reality I never imagined it to be so depressing and so
so horrible what happened
That was the documentary they talked about the man that got his head chopped off.
and oh yeah
no he doesn't remember
I don't remember exactly don't remember but... what I remember is that night when they bombarded and so many people died, even nowadays they showed one
one recuen- of now the visit of this president.
Right
It was there and people were protesting that ¿why didn't the current president do something to remember the victims there?
i think they were called The Risho's, from the Chinese sector, where all that village practically disappeared
Oh, from Churillo
Uh, from Chorrillo, exactly.
Yeah, that, that's where it was. The police was there, a part of the police
Right. But that one you're talking about, look, it happens just like that in Venezuela with the current president. Some things are happening that, you know they're happening
they happened a long time ago; so they say here "Something's happening in Venezuela" and i don't know. Asshole, the other day i wrote to one of the journalists at
Univision. I told them not to be so cynical, don't show things that aren't real, the first thing people tells you is: "huh, that president"
and god knows what, "he's a mad man", no, the truth is that they're twisting the information so that they make him look like a monster,
a dictator, well, a dictator, and we've been through four elections already, and 4 referendums, i mean, it can't be more democratic. But it's his personality, and he has a personality that's
It's uncommon, and people doesn't accept that. And he's not vulgar, he's not common, and people doesn't accept that, so he even is the first to criticize all that
Yeah, that
And, and, oh, well, i don't know if you've heard him
No, no, because like i told you, i don't really look much at the news, every now and then.
Sure, sure. look, there's a website in the internet where you can watch TV from all countries, including Panama of course, it's called
TV 4 all, like TV four all
TV
four all
Yes four
four it is a number four
aha
-TV Number four all
-TV or TV for all
exactly, exactly there you go
with
it is dot com yes
OK
there you se programming from all the channels all the channels of the world then there of course Panama and Venezuela.  And there now I, now I watch television from Venezuela
But I specifically watch the government channel there, the national channel.  Because the other channels belong to the opposition, so of course it is a little more of the same
but I like to watch it to see what stupidities they are saying.
OK
Then I compare it and since I have this webpage now I don't turn the TV on.  Now we are there glued to the internet watching the channels from
from around the world a little bit like to buy you see, what is happening and even we are doing the same with radio we listen to community radio, radio that you feel it is
it is truly telling you the truth or at least the other side of the coin let's not say that it is the truth one hundred percent because sometimes it is not
I mean it is not I don't know, but you can't say either that that all that the others tell us it is not but
aha.
damn truly they manipulate it too much.
yes
I don't know if you
Tell me?
Did you give yourself one, I don't know if you saw here a movie called Auto fox
no, maybe but I don't remember
It was a documentary that worked at Fox News
mmh
and well they practically forced them to say what was not and then they decided to resign from the station and besides resigning they got together and started to protest at a certain level
well, at a certain, a local level to tell the world how they were doing inside Fox News.  It is very interesting, it is called something like
"Fox Workers who are Outside"
some
Something like out or out
aha
and Fox like Fox News
My name is
Hi my name is Fernanda
Hi Fernanda, how are you? My name is Claudia.
How is-?
Where are you speak-? Good. From where are you speaking?
from Washington
Ah, which one of the two?
Washington, ~DC
Ah, yes because, after, I think there two no?
Yes, Washington State
Ah, OK and the other
And you, where are you?
Yes I'm here in Idaho state, I don't know if you've heard of it.
Yes, yes, yes of course
Yes, this one, the truth is a lot of that is movies, the truth is, a lot of things,em from my point of view really there isn't much in common with me because after
you don't know how to classify it very, very well. Eh, for example, after sometimes they say it's ~PG and after eh, you see that movie and really
You have a lot of profanity and, and pornography that sometimes is more forward for example ~PG thirteen sometimes is more, I don't know, it's quieter
And there isn't too many things like nudity and profanity. For me honestly, ah those classifications for me no, sometimes no
They don't know, people that critique those movies no, don't know how to classify them or, or I don't know what your point of view would be.
Yes, honestly I don't know much about movies because
ha
lets say, i don't have kid or anything, so I'm never aware
ha
what, what a classification
ha
but i think that the majority of people that we have, lets say during half day, is when most kids are at home
ha
they're things that are not really appropriate for the majority.
yeah
and i think that the americans, like um, their morals have lowered, do you understand? so
yeah
more things are normal, i don't think they should be that way
yeah, that's true, because, once, well, i don't have cable, i have normal cable, the ones that
ha
but for example, i had cable for a little while, and sometimes like, what at like? ten in the morning, and i like changing channels.
so that i can choose my program, that I'm going to see during that time.
mhm
and sometimes the put some movies that are not right for a ten years old, he was watching it, and i was changing him at the same time.
i stopped in that channel, there were things that were for adults
of course
The I said, ufm I said I thought the kids, I said, well, I, I I'm married, three years married and i have, a boy of almost 2 years old
OK
Maybe my son will grow and maybe this will move forward for the worst. Then
Of course, and
imagine later the kind of cartoons gone to, well I remember that once I was watching television. Look, in Mexico, I'm from Mexico city
Um
It was ten at night exactly, ten at night. Then, I had, eh, I had cable there and had the, the, the cable to
the channel that here is ten and six, then there was a cartoon in english. Because at night the show some in english, some in Spanish
and there was an English cartoon. Then I quit. And, thi- my mom was , then, then, was quite watching a cartoon television channel
Well, the monkeys started to show up naked
ah
and the monkey was startind to do its things with the two cartoons. And it was a cartoon, and then at night, and my mom told me
it's horrible
she turned off the television and had to explain me a little because she does not, not, she was surprised because I was watchin a cartoon channel, a normal channel
Then, the truth, now not even the cartoons are safe
yes and that could happen to any kid watching television
Sometimes cartoons yes
And you can not be on top, let's say, if the kid chages you can not jump and see, I mean, you have to trust, let's say, at least during the day
yes
the programming will not have naked stuff or groos things or anything like that
yes, yes it is true.  But really it is not the cartoons I'm sorry, Japanese cartoons are are the most rated eh, they have.  In Mexico eh
eh, on Cablevision and Multivision, which would be what cable here there in Mexico, doesn't have too many restrictions.  But for example, on regular television, normal channels
they have like more, more restrictions.  Eh not so much on other cables and, for example in, on TV, for example, normal channels for children
television like that, any channel, the, channel, for example which is five in caricatures
yes
for example, then it goes until ten at night, eleven and you an watch TV and they don't show such ugly programs.  Well
in Mexico City, mmh
before, in Mexico.  But for example, if you are watching a cable channel you already risk that the cartoon can be about something that sometimes that some
things of pornography or more nudity.
I yes, I look, I am Colombian and I think that in Colombia
Then, uy aha
television is much better that here in this sense.
aha
because, can happen, let's say at ten at night and the programs that they sure are never, you don't run the risk, no? that they are as bad as here.  Here
aha
it is more here not even at ten or any time you run the risk of seeing anything
yes, yes it is true, the other, well eh, I was with a neighbor, imagine I was with a neighbor, it was twelve, twelve thirty in the day.
Then her boy was watching eh, the a cartoon channel and then the girl decided to change the TV and and it was another channel that also was programmed for them, for children.
Well there was a program where there was, where there was a, a girl who had adventures of a girl and who was in a hospital
and suddenly went there the same hospital it was already happening that like, his mom was having her brother
ah, yes?
Aha, but you could see it and I grabbed her and I told her, to her mother and she told me, there is no problem, it is a channel of
of, of cartoons, of, of they show shows.  And, sincerely it was it was, no, they didn't leave much to the imagination.  It was really like posing, well but it was an operations room where the woman was having her baby.
what a horror.
They were, they are six years old.
yes
Because they are twins, she has, eh, both are six years old.  And their mother was letting them see that, well each, each parent allows them to see what
whatever they want.  But honestly, I, I don't want to explain so much to my children at this moment, because honestly I watch more what they
what they watch.  no? in that respect.  But, uf
yes, imagine when, let's say there are there are babysitters and things like that you don't have center and you are not at home to see
mm aha
you don't know what they are watching, when they go to their friends' or anything.
yes no
I think
yes, it is like that, really those ratings they give. And n- and n- and, principally from the television.  The truth already already n-
they don't leave nothing to the my- to the imagination, they show it to you.
yes
Already at any at any time of the day you watch one of those soap operas.  I don't like watching soap operas.  But, you see
how much- mom is at home and has little children three, four years, five or more or are at home and see, they are watching their soap opera
and always- there are scenes were they are, the, a couple, there they are having relations.
Mhm.
And in broad daylight, because the soap operas then passed from one to six in the morning until it was dark.
Clearly
And that's the way it is. It leaves nothing to the imagination.
No, I
Then, the programs are already sorted, and a scene of pornography on television at any time of day is normal. And for many
parents, this unfortunately is normal.
Exactly
And I think that if parents would talk to the television stations and say that they should require more stringent programs, like the privacy of scenes, such scenes
I think it would go down a bit. But that no longer happens, and even if parents and their children see something, they're like, "Oh, okay, no problem."
They don't care, mhm.
That will be taught. And then, so will these classifications I do not like. And I don't think these producers care. I feel that to them it is because
if a movie has a sex scene or is too rude for people to buy or for people to see it, it gives them laughs
or is sometimes called to attention because it has a very strong scene. Sometimes these things do more to help them.
Helps producers to sell.
Sometimes, and
Then, no. For me in particular, the movies I like to tell you the truth are Disney
children's films. I like them.
Yes, yes, yes.
Though now I'm married and I love all that. I have some here from another Disney movie. Honestly, I do not like movies.
strong so, that have a lot things of sex, because i am going to repeat myself i have more children and in awhile i am not going to be
at least if they going to put a movie, then the movie will have to be decent at least, that don't have a lot stuff
sure sure
that if we keep going like that maybe until Disney is going to be porno right? so
yes we don't know how its going to change
no so, if this is getting true, this is getting very far, if you turn on the TV you watch a commercial
of female pads, it seems good so almost they are going to explain how to they put a naked woman and they are going to
put there how to place the pad
exactly
because sometimes even they draw her, i don't know i have seen the commercials  so you dont afraid because your big no? but
but if a boy or a girl is watching by example and you say if the mom is there its fine and if his friends
answer you can explain the bad information so
i am getting use to it myself do you understand me? we say
so now yes
like i sometimes i see that i don't realize how much are changing the things
Good evening, I'm Mariza from Philadelphia.
Hello, Hello, my name is Juan.  You are Marisol.
Mariza, Mariza.
Maybe--Mariza, we talked a few days ago, I believe, right?
Oh, maybe yes.
It could be, I'm in San Antonio, Texas.
In San Antonio, yes.
Okay, so today's theme is, uh, the question of religion.
Yes, which is a very complicated and polemical.
Exactly, like how the need for religion is something that, that we all have, I suppose.
Mm-hmm.
And this like all needs institutions try to,
Yes,
to provide an answer.  And it ends up being a form of control, right?
It is really today in this country.  Uh, in the United States too, there's a big, big problem with religion, that it mixes with politics and there are a lot of people on the right who want control.
They intend to control the country based on religion also, and it can be positive or negative for many people, well, it helps to pray or to believe in something, it helps them and others, in others, of others
in another form, it, it, Christianity is the most powerful religion in the world and they are the most, let's say they have the most power to influence politicians in those countries.
if you look at that case, for example here where I live, once I went to a church.
Mm-hm
That totally represented an ideological project, but that by plan is among the most conservative groups there is in the United States.
mhm,yes
Then they exercise a very direct power, very clear trying to influence the people there at church.
yes
In the sermon,above all what attracted my attention against the public school.
mhm
Directly against public school, and they were praying so God could free us from public school one day.
for real?
Why what yes,
ah ah,no
and against the theory that,that they try to see the evolucion theory,no.
So that I have heard that,yes.
No,terrible they said Because it is harrassing to teachers that teach the bible, to explain world creation?
Exactly,yes there are many problems,yes.
Well the train will take me, well I say well is that,with all reason,no the bible does not explain the world.
No each can believe what they want, what happens is that they try to impose their  belief for all the world and to be the bible that it be the what think
Exactly,they are fundamentalism,no
Yes what fundamentalism yes,yes,yes the right but it ia also the country is eh,the power is with the party and the All from the president and all involved in is, in the white house they are all the conservative rights.
whites,the eh cristians and what are they what the people with power in the country.the ones that have the companies all the world are same they are many people fundamental conservative at right they want to remove the law.
The right to have an abortion,for example how another question was about homosexuality, gay marriages, the beleif right the of
yes more scientific no,no we should not believe only on what they say, they say God created man and woman also to give an opinion so the children can beleive.
that was Charles Darwin the theory of evolution. And
yes
And it's very complicated, the, the other question was about homosexuality, yes, yes, if everyone was the same or believed the same, there would be no problems, it asked.
But
But I think that maybe, the more similar we are, the more problems we have, no.
yes
In that sense, differences help complement.
Sure, for me, I don't have any,
The topic, the topic of homosexuality is very polemic,
mhm
But in a given time, it's not a, let's see, like tolerance the phenomenon of homosexuality must be something, that, that in which we're very well informed, no, I personally think for example before I thought,
it could be a deviation, homosexuality, but lately I have read that it's also a question, a genetic issue.
Yes I, I'm convinced that it's that because I know many people that are,
No
eh, well homosexuals, or lesbians and, I'm very well informed and then for that yes, always I don't know because. Since I am, since I was a girl,
Like you accept people for, I didn't think that they were better nor worse for being homosexuals and everyone has a right to to, well I don't know, to marry, to,
Well yes,
to be with whom they want. It's the same if it's a man or a woman, I care, I don't care and I think that they have the same rights because they are citizens all the same, and they pay the same taxes.
yes
They should have the right to marry, to live with anyone.
yes yes I agree with you, I believe exactly that, they all have rights, well we can have any kind of person and in this case with respect to the relative rights of marriage.
well a lot of people pose the question of homosexuality as an issue, very perverse and that they have the right to marriage, not when it's a quest- of when the marriage is in reality a contract
mhm
between two people that decide to do something in common.
Sure, but the, the church doesn't see it like that.
No,
think that that's an abomination because marriage is defined as a union between a man and woman they believe, and it, and the people and the devoted Christian fundamentalists just like I was saying before they see this as an abomination, and they are so closed off that they don't understand that.
that's maybe how it was before, the way people thought before was traditional, but now the times are changing and everyone well, is equal and as they were before, homosexuality has always been, since the beginning of mankind, but what's happened now is that before there was a way to deal with it and now well
it's going, I don't know things are becoming more liberal, and let's say and people don't have fear anymore to say, well I'm homosexual, or I'm gay or I'm whatever I am
that's the problem. The church has a problem, but they can't do anything because
aha
People are accepting the fact that people, yeah well if you at a person who's homosexual, yes and they're worthwhile people. So then
Of course yes it's an extreme of the, eh, the family and marriage, the ecclesiastical institution and the blessings of God for a marriage and things that when in reality
well the church and religion are forms of institution, it's also that in school, there's
Sure.
The necessity of first to change and find new, new ways of learning the lessons of life.
Yes.
About society and of individuals, right.
Yes, religion has to be something personal, not something that is to be mixed with politics, each person can, the, whatever he thinks, whatever he believes, doesn't have any reason to
eh, well look just because you don't think that same way I do, because you're not like I am, well, like they punish them for not being the same, and that's not, each person can think what they want, to believe in who or whatever, it doesn't have to
by Christians, because they speak ill of the Muslims because they say they are radicals or talk ill of the, of the atheists because they do not believe in God and they call them heretics or,
But I don´t know,
aha
That is not very Christian if so, you have to accept people like they are, and every one believe or have his own religion, but that is the problem of the fundamentalists, they don´t accept differences
Yes well, but in this case, to accept the differences looks like something that relates to a matter of humanity, right?
hmm
Is like a paradox to do not accept the difference they think but, aha
What happens is that if,It is that in this country the children when they are, those families, christian families, from the right wing, let´s say they raise their children in a way that, they teach them since they are very little that things must be that way, and then, then
when they are adults and meet different people then they say, that is not that way, because I was taught that is like this, and this, and this and it must be like this
You know they are very radicals, not, they don´t accept the differences because they were raised in a way their parents did, then
yes
For example, me, I had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of all the races, several cultures, then I am open minded to everything.
aha
And because of that when I see a person that is not, I immediately know it, only by seeing the person I say, this person is not going to accept me because I am not like her, I am not, I don´t think alike, I don´t look alike
But it is that there are people of all kinds and, and well there must be radicals Christians there must be everything, but I think that if, the country has a lot of influence, the religion, yes
Eh, yes, it has a lot of influence, what amazes me is that in this case,
yes
In this country, they are so fundamentalists, right?
Yes I they are
With the churches, there is a good proportion of fundamentalists even in the president speech there are some fundamentalism,
Of course, yes yes.
not there,
The message is very clear and it has been five years of ruling, and when Bill Clinton was in office, well, he wasn't much, he was more open, of course he was a leftist, more opene- one more person.
that understood more the things to the persons and, this government  take it, the religious the christian of righties I mean the ones who are
Saying how things are made in the country and that is why there is so much controversy with marriage it's also with, the  supreme court, with the jury who want them to be righties and religious, well ,
catholics or whatever they might be they also want to, to take off the rights of abortion and stuff like that, that is, ridiculous in this height of this century.
right
Like they, they want things to go backwards, go backwards instead of going forward they want things to be like thirty or forty years and that can't be.
But, that is how we are right now.
right, and you have, practically some religion in particular?
Me in my family we are, In Spain I am cat- Catholicism say is when you are born and they baptize you, the first communion and all that.
Of course.
I think I'm goo and I have my thoughts but I don't go to church every Sunday nor practice religion, I know but don't practice, I am I think
But we say that I speak for myself and what we say I will carry with me
yes
or, or I'm not and won't be I am very open and it would be contradictory if I thought that I am Catholic but I know I'm not I am not covered
if the same thing happens to me sometimes and when I have a temporary problems with the church because it's Catholic I can almost almost hear you say that there is a sense of integration and community here
It seems they have interest in all.
yes, yes, yes there is a lot of economic interest
then no
The is the problem, it's that they are not immediately interested in happiness, they are interested in the money an
yes
and also they are seen not to be very faithful as there have been many cases of child abuse and things like child abuse
you hear these things and wonder how this can be possible that a priest does this to a child and there is much controversy about that
yes
but we say that faith is not that each individual is free to believe whatever you want and practice it but also have respect for others who are not well
I see
But there are many religion that it occurs in that is the Christian religion and more is said as it is the most abundant religion in the world, is the most and has the most power
Well in the world that is not true just because we have it on this side of the world because I do not think most would think it even the majority of Christians believe that there are more Muslims than Christians
Yes but the problem is they don't have much economic power.
mhm
Hi, good evening.
Yes, good evening.
Good evening. My names is Carolina.
OH, How are you Carolina? Your are speaking with Alex
How are you Alex?
from Los Angeles.
Oh, very good, I am, I am in New York.
oh, okay, I thought that, that, that it was another person. Are you okay?
Yeah,
I am here from Los Angeles.
Oh, well, very good. Please to talk to you.
please to talk to you.
Well, tonight we have to talk, about technical appliances.
Where are you from?
I am from Peru.
oh, okay
and you?
Eh, I am of Colombian residence.
Colombian?
mhm
Oh, but you speak like a mexican.
Because here we speak in Mexican spanish.
Right.
That's why.
Oh, right, sure.
You get the, you get the accent of where you live.
Oh.
With the, when i lived in Spain i got the, the Spanish accent.
Uh um.
When i lived in Colombia, i got the Colombian spanish. Specially the one from Bogota.
Uh um.
Now i got the Mexican spanish.
Oh, that's good.
Which is what's spoken here.
Right, yes.
Oh, and, i think that Hispanics here are like ninety five per cent mexican.
Yeah, sure, right.
Yes.
Yes. Well, tonight's subject is about technological devices.
Yes, well, i use, i use computers.
Yeah.
and ah, I have D S L really fast now.
Mhm.
Yes, I love it because I like it because the fast Internet, I don't like waiting for pages
Yeah, aha.
so it's very useful because I'm look for work, I do surveys look for women
Mhm.
mma-, many things and, and I don't like to wait for the, the pages, you get me?
Mhm. Yea, aha
I like to do it quickly and, and before it, when I was when I had the line, by phone
yes.
it was very slow.
Very slow, yes.
So I had to wait some two or three minutes just for a single page to appear
Yeay, sure.
and so far, well, I don't have a webcam and, and the webcam comes up fast with the D S L
Yeah, sure.
The webcam is when they can see you ah, like in tele-, li-, video conference conference
Mm. Mhm.
it's fast.
Um, yeah, of course.
¿And you?
Well, to me, also, sure, and i work, my work, i am a manager, and then uh, i use it for work and to me, the computer, i mean that
the most essential, and mostly, uh, and the new technologies, ¿right?, the new technology that has come out and every day new things come out, ¿right?
Yes
And, i have really adapted well and I've loved it since i've been using the computer. Because before, when we used the typing machine, it was so slow to
write forms and documents, and everything, now everything is done through the computer and the interer, ¿right?, so, it's something wonderful
To me, it's essential, i think i don't know what i could do without the computer, ¿right?, so, I'm really happy with this new technology, and i wish it keeps
going forward more every day, ¿right?
Um, sure, i think that, they have, uh, they have done more discoveries on the computer than what they have on medicine.
That's true
The computer is the most advanced thing in today's civilization.
Right, yes, and for everything, ¿right?, i mean, it's all you
Yes
want, you can find it there, and when you take a seat on the, well, i use it for work, but also when I'm home and i need
some information, well, i sit on the computer and no one can stop me, that when it's like, an essential part of your life, ¿right?
Yes, exactly
For everything, because if you need to know how's the weather out there, well, you go to the computer
News, sports
Before it was, um
Ah, dates with women, everything.
yes, yes, yes.
No, and even this survey that we are discussing now, I found it online too.
Oh, yes, also, oh
yes, almost mm, so the Internet does have a lot of influence
Sure, how many calls have you made?
in our lives. Twenty two, this is a, twenty two calls.
Oh, and he, so you are almost done
Yes, I'm almost done, I still have three left, one of them is a call in which someone spoke mostly in English, so I think I will have to replace him.
Oh, I see, I see.
But, who knows!
Yeah, aha.
Because I did speak in Spanish, so maybe they will count that one too.
Mm, I see.
Because if you speak in English, they don't count the call.
But, do they make the payment once you finish the twenty five calls, or not?
Yes, they do, they replace the call.
yes, oh, I see, aha.
I spoke with him, I know the owner
Oh, really?
And, I'm going to ask him if i have to replace him.
Oh, uh, ¿do you know the owner?
Yes.
Oh, that's good.
Yes, it's easy, he's easy to talk to.
Oh, he's from, ¿is he from California?
No, he must be in Philadelphia.
Oh, right, right, right.
But, but he gave me the phone num-
Oh, ¿but do you know him in person?
No, no, no, no.
Oh, just through the computer.
Yes, i know him through the computer, but he
through the internet, ok, right.
But he, he talks to the participants.
Oh, yeah, oh, ¿yeah?, oh, no, i have never spoken to him, i.
Yes, then if you have any question, you can, hes Chinese
Oh, ¿yeah?
Yeah, well-, i don't know if he's the owner, he is
Oh.
the, the manager
yes.
yes, that, supervisor of, the project they are doing.
Okay, okay, okay
yes, is that they are studying how we speak Spanish.
Yes, of course and
I don't know, if , if you knew.
yes, yes, I knew, and besides yes, I think that also another one is going to start after one finishes this one.
No, no I don't know, but is possible that yes, because I, I have already done two.
MM
One in English and another one in Spanish.
Oh, this one is your second, oh, yes?
yes, and this what we are doing now is technology
Oh Oh.
because they are doing connections by the telephone
Okay, Okay Ah and the other one was the same, twenty-five calls?
and this is technology. yes, something like that, it was the same thing, but it was in English.
Okay and they paid you the same also?
And they paid the same.
Oh, okay, okay,
yes, I like to do that not just for the payment, but they give me the opportunity
Ah, how great.
to speak in Spanish
Of course.
because it is the, the only tine in, in the day when I speak Spanish.
Mm, ya.
I, I speak very little Spanish now, it is more my day in English.
Oh, OK, aha.
yes.
OK.
And what technology do you use more? This is what we are doing now is technology.
Well- Of course, of course it is.
This couldn't have been done twenty, thirty years ago what we are doing now
Exactly, aha
because they are using multiple phone lines to connect many people who live in different parts of the country.
Exactly.
I believe that telephone technology, they have made advances also because now I can make long distance calls and they don't cost me anything because you pay
ah, a monthly fee
Aha
and you can make al the calls you want.
Oh, but right here
That wasn't like that like 5, 10 or 20 years ago
Of course, but here at the United States
Yes, Here at the Sates
Yes of course, I just get a Verizon phone they were offering to make free calls here at the states
yes
And they charge me
They charge something each moth, but only if you make a lot of calls, but it's worth it
Yes, of course
And you know what, someday, they will make it internationally to your favorite country
Oh, that's nice
You pay a monthly fee and you can call the times you like
Okay
yes
That's really good, it would be excellent to call your country anytime you like. I think it will be true, because with that other thing, the cards,
back in time it was really expensive, do you remember?, For calling your country
Now is cheaper, right?
A lot cheaper
And why is that?, Technology
Yeah, you're right
yes, the technology.
Now you can speak three or five hours for 5 dollars.
Exactly.
Before it was only a minute, oh my god it was about like eight.
One minute was twenty cents, yes.
Yes, I remember that I had to talk, I think that ten minutes alone used to cost me like twenty-five dollaras.
Mm.
and I had to be very careful cause they used to be with forward clock, no ?
yes, yes, yes, It also happened to me too
yes, like that
yes yes, ah, I remember that you had to be with the clock in your had.
Aha, Clearly. Yes.
Yes, but eh. with,
yes, I've had it. The truth is that for ten years I've been wihing for the technologies to advance. No ?
Because it has to be advanced, no ?
What happens is that how technology is advancing and the technology is aleady in the hands of the majority of the people
Mhm. Mhm
Then the services are a lot cheaper because they sell them to a lot more people
Of course, yes.
Do you understand me ?
Mmm, cla-
Eh, as an example, it is the computer, the computer five years ago, cost about two, two or three thousand dollars.
Exactly, yes.
nowadays you can buy a computer for two hundred or three hundred dollars
Ah, yes, it is true, aha.
because there is, there is more demand.
Now of course, of course, aha.
Because there is the technology it was, it has advanced.
Ah, yes, it is true.
What I would like to see
yes.
more advanced technology, with medicine.
Mm.
They have to look for cures like ah, cancer eh, if you can go to the moon, why can't they find a cure for cancer? yes it can be, yes they can do a
True.
Super fast computer that can think, why can't they find a cure to cancer?
Mm. Mm.
I want to see more advances on illnesses, I believe that they are going too slow in that area.
Mm, OK.
I have not seen many advances in, about illnesses in the last ten, twenty, thirty, forty years.
mm.mm
Well-
its true, how many years has cancer been around for?
Yea, how many people, right? does it kill.
and there's no cure, right? they cant find one, right?
right? and that shortens a lot of peoples lives
Yeah,yeah.yeah
Or heart disease as well.
Mhm, HIV, since its not mentioned almost everywhere.
HIV, is more advanced than cancer, in in
well, that's true.
In the sense of controlling the virus, because there are drugs to control it.
yeah.yeah.
But cancer goes through your system too slow.
mm, yea
have you ever heard about a new cure for cancer?
no,no,no,no its true.
I havent. nothing.
HA
its slow
Yes.
They could improve that.
Well, sure.
Yes.
I wish, right?, i wish that there's something, that God enlightens them, so that they can find something that can, uh, cure this catastrophe that cancer is, no matter how old you are, but that gets to you, right?
Yes, yes.
That anyone can get.
I, i had a friend that died young, at thirty two, and one day she got cancer.
Yes, right.
And she died in three days.
Oh my god, ¿in three days?, oh.
Yes, because she had a bleeding in her brain.
Oh my god.
And, and she died immediately, she had luk, leukemia, in the blood.
Oh, i see.
And that, she got that overnight.
Oh my god.
Right. And they couldn't do anything about it, right?
Uh
They couldn't, uh-
